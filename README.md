# Misc Analysis of random datasets

Just some basic analysis of small datasets in R that was relevant at some time in my life

* [Sanger publications](https://github.com/hui-tony-zk/Analysis/tree/master/sanger_publications) was done prior to my PhD program interview at the [Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/) in England - The big sequencing powerhouse of Europe.
* [Dac and AraC effects on the epigenome in leukemic cells](https://github.com/hui-tony-zk/Analysis/tree/master/dac_araC_aml) was analyzed as part of [URO](uroubc.ca) mentoring
