Here we tested the in vivo role of the mouse Ren-1c enhancer. In renin-expressing As4.1 cells stably transfected with Ren-1c promoter with or without enhancer, expression of linked beta-geo reporter, stable expression, and colony formation were dependent on the presence of the enhancer. We then generated mice carrying a targeted deletion of the enhancer (REKO mice) and found marked depletion of renin in renal juxtaglomerular and submandibular ductal cells, as well as hyperplasia of macula densa cells. Plasma creatinine was increased, but electrolytes were normal. Male REKO mice implanted with telemetry devices had 9 +/- 1 mm Hg lower mean arterial pressure (p &lt; 0.001), which was partly normalized by a high NaCl diet. Locomotor activity was lower, and baroreflex sensitivity was normal. Markedly reduced mean arterial pressure variability in the midfrequency band indicated a contribution of reduced sympathetic vasomotor tone to the hypotension. In conclusion, the renin enhancer is critical for renin gene expression and physiological sequelae, including response to alteration in salt intake. The REKO mouse may be useful as a low renin expression model.</p>

We describe mutations in the DNA and ligand binding domains of human PPARgamma in lipodystrophic, severe insulin resistance. These receptor mutants lack DNA binding and transcriptional activity but can translocate to the nucleus, interact with PPARgamma coactivators and inhibit coexpressed wild-type receptor. Expression of PPARgamma target genes is markedly attenuated in mutation-containing versus receptor haploinsufficent primary cells, indicating that such dominant-negative inhibition operates in vivo. Our observations suggest that these mutants restrict wild-type PPARgamma action via a non-DNA binding, transcriptional interference mechanism, which may involve sequestration of functionally limiting coactivators.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Department of Cell Biology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.</p><p class="abstract">Histolysis refers to a widespread disintegration of tissues that is morphologically distinct from apoptosis and often associated with the stimulation of autophagy. Here, we establish that a component of the apoptosome, and pivotal regulator of apoptosis, is also required for histolytic cell death. Using in vivo and ex vivo assays, we demonstrate a global apoptogenic requirement for dark, the fly ortholog of Apaf1, and show that a required focus of dark(-) organismal lethality maps to the central nervous system. We further demonstrate that the Dark protein itself is a caspase substrate and find that alterations of this cleavage site produced the first hypermorphic point mutation within the Apaf1/Ced-4 gene family. In a model of ;autophagic cell death&#39;, dark was essential for histolysis but dispensable for characteristic features of the autophagic program, indicating that the induction of autophagy occurs upstream or parallel to histolytic cell death. These results demonstrate that stimulation of autophagy per se is not a ;killing event&#39; and, at the same time, establish that common effector pathways, regulated by the apoptosome, can underlie morphologically distinct forms of programmed cell death.</p>

Here, we determine the phylogenetic relationship between EhV-86 and other large dsDNA viruses. Twenty-five core genes common to nuclear-cytoplasmic large dsDNA virus genomes were identified in the EhV-86 genome; sequence from eight of these genes were used to create a phylogenetic tree in which EhV-86 was placed firmly with the two other members of the Phycodnaviridae. We have also identified a 100-kb region of the EhV-86 genome which appears to have transferred into this genome from an unknown source. Furthermore, the presence of six RNA polymerase subunits (unique among the Phycodnaviridae) suggests both a unique evolutionary history and a unique lifestyle for this intriguing virus.</p>

Proteomic studies of the synapse have revealed that the postsynaptic density is the most complex multiprotein structure yet identified, with approximately 10(3) different proteins. Such studies, however, use brain tissue with many different regions and therefore different cell types, and there is clear potential for heterogeneity of protein content at different synapses within and between brain regions. Although large-scale mRNA-based assays are in progress to map this sort of complexity at the cellular level, and indeed all brain-expressed genes, analysis of protein distribution (at synapses and other structures) is still in the very early stages. We review existing large-scale protein expression studies and the specific technical obstacles that need to be overcome before applying the scaling used in nucleic acid based approaches.</p>

In order to further clarify the karyotype relationships at the lower taxonomic level in Vespertilionidae, genome-wide comparative maps have been constructed between Myotis myotis (MMY, 2n = 44) and six vesper bats from China: Myotis altarium (MAL, 2n = 44), Hypsugo pulveratus (HPU, 2n = 44), Nyctalus velutinus (NVE, 2n = 36), Tylonycteris robustula (TRO, 2n = 32), Tylonycteris sp. (TSP, 2n = 30)and Miniopterus fuliginosus (MFU, 2n = 46) by cross-species chromosome painting with a set of painting probes derived from flow-sorted chromosomes of Myotis myotis. Each Myotis myotis autosomal probe detected a single homologous chromosomal segment in the genomes of these six vesper bats except for MMY chromosome 3/4 paint which hybridized onto two chromosomes in the genome of M. fuliginosus. Our results show that Robertsonian translocation is the main mode of karyotype evolution in Vespertilionidae and that the addition of heterochromatic material also plays an important role in the karyotypic evolution of the genera Tylonycteris and Nyctalus. Two conserved syntenic associations (MMY9 + 23 and 18 + 19) could be the synapomorphic features for the genus Tylonycteris. The integration of our maps with the published maps has enabled us to deduce chromosomal homologies between human and these six vesper bats and provided new insight into the karyotype evolution of the family Vespertilionidae.</p>

The challenge is to reconstruct a descriptive model from these lists that reflects the underlying biological processes as accurately as possible. Once we have such a model or network, what can we learn from it? Specifically, given that we are interested in some biological process associated with the model, what new properties can we predict and subsequently test? Here, we describe, at an introductory level, a range of bioinformatics techniques that can be systematically applied to proteomic datasets. When combined, these methods give us a global overview of the network and the properties of the proteins and their interactions. These properties can then be used to predict functional pathways within the network and to examine substructure. To illustrate the application of these methods, we draw upon our own work concerning a complex of 186 proteins found in neuronal synapses in mammals. The techniques discussed are generally applicable and could be used to examine lists of proteins involved with the biological response to electric or magnetic fields.</p>

Fission yeast has at least one GO annotation for 98.3% of its genes (excluding annotations to &#39;unknown&#39; terms), greater than the current percentage coverage for any other organism. Approximately 65% (3225 gene products) have at least one annotation to each of the three ontologies (biological process, cellular component and molecular function). Approximately 30% (1443 gene products) have GO terms derived directly from small-scale experiments in fission yeast, supporting the validity of fission yeast as a model eukaryote and a reference organism.</p>

However, not all the pedigrees with a phenotype consistent with ADLTE show mutations in LGI1/Epitempin, or evidence for linkage to the 10q24 locus. Other authors as well as ourselves have found an internal repeat (EPTP, pfam# PF03736) that allowed the identification of three other genes sharing a sequence and structural similarity with LGI1/Epitempin. In this work, we present the sequencing of these genes in a set of ADLTE families without mutations in both LGI1/Epitempin and sporadic cases.

We previously identified the 40S ribosomal protein S2 (rpS2) as a substrate of the protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (RMT3) and reported a misregulation of the 40S/60S ratio in rmt3 deletion mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. For this study, using DNA microarrays, we have investigated the genome-wide biological response of rmt3-null cells to this ribosomal subunit imbalance. Whereas little change was observed at the transcriptional level, a number of genes showed significant alterations in their polysomal-to-monosomal ratios in rmt3Delta mutants. Importantly, nearly all of the 40S ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs showed increased ribosome density in rmt3 disruptants. Sucrose gradient analysis also revealed that the ribosomal subunit imbalance detected in rmt3-null cells is due to a deficit in small-subunit levels and can be rescued by rpS2 overexpression. Our results indicate that rmt3-null fission yeast compensate for the reduced levels of small ribosomal subunits by increasing the ribosome density, and likely the translation efficiency, of 40S ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs. Our findings support the existence of autoregulatory mechanisms that control ribosome biosynthesis and translation as an important layer of gene regulation.</p>

NMDA receptors are known to play a key role in the formation of these maps; however, the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the effects of glutamate are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that SynGAP, a synaptic Ras GTPase activating protein, is essential for the anatomical development of whisker-related patterns in the developing somatosensory pathways in rodent forebrain. Mice lacking SynGAP show only partial segregation of barreloids in the thalamus, and thalamocortical axons segregate into rows but do not form whisker-related patches. In cortex, layer 4 cells do not aggregate to form barrels. In Syngap(+/-) animals, barreloids develop normally, and thalamocortical afferents segregate in layer 4, but cell segregation is retarded. SynGAP is not necessary for the development of whisker-related patterns in the brainstem. Immunoelectron microscopy for SynGAP from layer 4 revealed a postsynaptic localization with labeling in developing postsynaptic densities (PSDs). Biochemically, SynGAP associates with the PSD in a PSD-95-independent manner, and Psd-95(-/-) animals develop normal barrels. These data demonstrate an essential role for SynGAP signaling in the activity-dependent development of whisker-related maps selectively in forebrain structures indicating that the intracellular pathways by which NMDA receptor activation mediates map formation differ between brain regions and developmental stage.</p>

In the fixed-effects meta-analysis, the pooled odds ratio for risk of type 2 diabetes per Ser482 allele was 1.07 (95% CI 1.00-1.15, p=0.044). Elimination of one of the studies from the meta-analysis gave a summary odds ratio of 1.11 (95% CI 1.04-1.20, p=0.004), with no between-study heterogeneity (p=0.475).

Here, we attempted to map 46 microsatellite markers at the chromosome arm level using flow-sorted chromosomes from three karyotypically different taxa of the Sorex araneus group (S. granarius and the chromosome races Cordon and Novosibirsk of S. araneus). The most likely localizations were provided for 35 markers, among which 25 were each unambiguously mapped to a single locus on the corresponding chromosomes in the three taxa, covering the three sexual chromosomes (XY1Y2) and nine of the 18 autosomal arms of the S. araneus group. The results provide further evidence for a high degree of conservation in genome organization in the S. araneus group despite the presence of numerous Robertsonian rearrangements. These markers can therefore be used to compare the genetic structure among taxa of the S. araneus group at the chromosome level and to study the role of chromosomal rearrangements in the genetic diversification and speciation process of this group.</p>

Expression of a polysaccharide capsule is essential for survival in the blood, and thus for virulence, but also is a target for host antibodies and the basis for effective vaccines. Encapsulated species typically exhibit antigenic variation and express one of a number of immunochemically distinct capsular polysaccharides that define serotypes. We provide the sequences of the capsular biosynthetic genes of all 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and relate these to the known polysaccharide structures and patterns of immunological reactivity of typing sera, thereby providing the most complete understanding of the genetics and origins of bacterial polysaccharide diversity, laying the foundations for molecular serotyping. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a complete repertoire of capsular biosynthetic genes has been available, enabling a holistic analysis of a bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis system. Remarkably, the total size of alternative coding DNA at this one locus exceeds 1.8 Mbp, almost equivalent to the entire S. pneumoniae chromosomal complement.</p>

Previous work has documented activating mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase in testicular germ-cell tumors (TGCT). To investigate further the potential role of mutated protein kinases in the development of TGCT and to characterize the prevalence and patterns of point mutations in these tumors, we have sequenced the coding exons and splice junctions of the annotated protein kinase family of 518 genes in a series of seven seminomas and six nonseminomas. Our results show a remarkably low mutation frequency, with only a single somatic point mutation, a K277E mutation in the STK10 gene, being identified in a total of more than 15 megabases of sequence analyzed. Sequencing of STK10 in an additional 40 TGCTs revealed no further mutations. Comparative genomic hybridization and LOH analysis using SNP arrays demonstrated that the 13 TGCTs mutationally screened through the 518 protein kinase genes were uniformly aneuploid with consistent chromosomal gains on 12p, 8q, 7, and X and losses on 13q, 18q, 11q, and 4q. Our results do not provide evidence for a mutated protein kinase implicated in the development of TGCT other than KIT. Moreover, they demonstrate that the general prevalence of point mutations in TGCT is low, in contrast to the high frequency of copy number changes.</p>

Despite this ubiquity, the vast majority of human infections in Europe and North America are thought to be due to only three genotypes. Using a genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we have constructed a genealogy for these three lines. The data indicate that types I and III are second- and first-generation offspring, respectively, of a cross between a type II strain and one of two ancestral strains. An extant T. gondii strain (P89) appears to be the modern descendant of the non-type II parent of type III, making the full genealogy of the type III clonotype known. The simplicity of this family tree demonstrates that even a single cross can lead to the emergence and dominance of a new clonal genotype that completely alters the population biology of a sexual pathogen.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Vertebrate Development Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, 44 Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, UK.</p><p class="abstract">Each of the sensory patches in the epithelium of the inner ear is a mosaic of hair cells and supporting cells. Notch signalling is thought to govern this pattern of differentiation through lateral inhibition. Recent experiments in the chick suggest, however, that Notch signalling also has a prior function - inductive rather than inhibitory - in defining the prosensory patches from which the differentiated cells arise. Several Notch ligands are expressed in each patch, but their individual roles in relation to the two functions of Notch signalling are unclear. We have used a Cre-LoxP approach to knock out two of these ligands, Delta1 (Dll1) and Jagged1 (Jag1), in the mouse ear. In the absence of Dll1, auditory hair cells develop early and in excess, in agreement with the lateral inhibition hypothesis. In the absence of Jag1, by contrast, the total number of these cells is strongly reduced, with complete loss of cochlear outer hair cells and some groups of vestibular hair cells, indicating that Jag1 is required for the prosensory inductive function of Notch. The number of cochlear inner hair cells, however, is almost doubled. This correlates with loss of expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) (Cdkn1b), suggesting that signalling by Jag1 is also needed to limit proliferation of prosensory cells, and that there is a core part of this population whose prosensory character is established independently of Jag1-Notch signalling. Our findings confirm that Notch signalling in the ear has distinct prosensory and lateral-inhibitory functions, for which different ligands are primarily responsible.</p>

Despite Hh being modified by Ct-cholesterol and Nt-palmitate adducts, Hh migrates far from its site of synthesis and programs cellular outcomes, depending on its local concentrations. We show that in the receiving cells of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, lipid-unmodified Hh spreads across many more cell diameters than the wild type and this spreading leads to the activation of low but not high threshold responses. Unlipidated Hh forms become internalized through the apical plasma membrane, while wild-type Hh enters through the basolateral cell surface - in all cases via a dynamin-dependent mechanism. Full activation of the Hh pathway and the spread of Hh throughout the extracellular matrix depend on the ability of lipid-modified Hh to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). However, neither Hh-lipid modifications nor HSPG function are required to activate the targets that respond to low levels of Hh. All these data show that the interaction of lipid-modified Hh with HSPG is important both for precise Hh spreading through the epithelium surface and for correct Hh reception.</p>

Notch1 is also involved in the control of cell fate choices in the developing central nervous system (Lewis, J. (1998) Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 9, 583-589). Here we report that Notch and beta1-integrins are co-expressed and that these proteins cooperate with the epidermal growth factor receptor in neural progenitors. We describe data that suggests that beta1-integrins may affect Notch signaling through 1) physical interaction (sequestration) of the Notch intracellular domain fragment by the cytoplasmic tail of the beta1-integrin and 2) affecting trafficking of the Notch intracellular domain via caveolin-mediated mechanisms. Our findings suggest that caveolin 1-containing lipid rafts play a role in the coordination and coupling of beta1-integrin, Notch1, and tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways. We speculate that this will require the presence of the adequate beta1-activating extracellular matrix or growth factors in restricted regions of the central nervous system and namely in neurogenic niches.</p>

Here we report synteny comparisons between these species, including details about chromosome relationships, large-scale synteny blocks, microsynteny within blocks, and genome regions lacking clear correspondence. The Lotus and Medicago genomes share a minimum of 10 large-scale synteny blocks, each with substantial collinearity and frequently extending the length of whole chromosome arms. The proportion of genes syntenic and collinear within each synteny block is relatively homogeneous. Medicago-Lotus comparisons also indicate similar and largely homogeneous gene densities, although gene-containing regions in Mt occupy 20-30% more space than Lj counterparts, primarily because of larger numbers of Mt retrotransposons. Because the interpretation of genome comparisons is complicated by large-scale genome duplications, we describe synteny, synonymous substitutions and phylogenetic analyses to identify and date a probable whole-genome duplication event. There is no direct evidence for any recent large-scale genome duplication in either Medicago or Lotus but instead a duplication predating speciation. Phylogenetic comparisons place this duplication within the Rosid I clade, clearly after the split between legumes and Salicaceae (poplar).</p>

At least 24 major chromosome rearrangements are required to convert the presumed ancestral karyotype of gibbons into that of the hominoid ancestor. Up to 28 additional rearrangements distinguish the various living species from the common gibbon ancestor. Using the northern white-cheeked gibbon (2n = 52) (Nomascus leucogenys leucogenys) as a model, we created a high-resolution map of the homologous regions between the gibbon and human. The positions of 100 synteny breakpoints relative to the assembled human genome were determined at a resolution of about 200 kb. Interestingly, 46% of the gibbon-human synteny breakpoints occur in regions that correspond to segmental duplications in the human lineage, indicating a common source of plasticity leading to a different outcome in the two species. Additionally, the full sequences of 11 gibbon BACs spanning evolutionary breakpoints reveal either segmental duplications or interspersed repeats at the exact breakpoint locations. No specific sequence element appears to be common among independent rearrangements. We speculate that the extraordinarily high level of rearrangements seen in gibbons may be due to factors that increase the incidence of chromosome breakage or fixation of the derivative chromosomes in a homozygous state.</p>

Mammalian based expression systems have advantages over bacterial systems for certain classes of protein but can be slower and more laborious. Thus the availability of a simple system for production and rapid screening of constructs or conditions for mammalian expression would be of great benefit. To this end we have coupled an efficient recombinant protein production system based on transient transfection in HEK-293 EBNA1 (HEK-293E) suspension cells with a dot blot method allowing pre-screening of proteins expressed in cells in a high throughput manner.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: A nested PCR approach was used to clone 21 extracellular domains of mouse receptors as CD4 fusions within a mammalian GATEWAY expression vector system. Following transient transfection, HEK-293E cells grown in 2 ml cultures in 24-deep well blocks showed similar growth kinetics, viability and recombinant protein expression profiles, to those grown in 50 ml shake flask cultures as judged by western blotting. Following optimisation, fluorescent dot blot analysis of transfection supernatants was shown to be a rapid method for analysing protein expression yielding similar results as western blot analysis. Addition of urea enhanced the binding of glycoproteins to a nitrocellulose membrane. A good correlation was observed between the results of a plate based small scale transient transfection dot blot pre-screen and successful purification of proteins expressed at the 50 ml scale.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The combination of small scale multi-well plate culture and dot blotting described here will allow the multiplex analysis of different mammalian expression experiments enabling a faster identification of high yield expression constructs or conditions prior to large scale protein production.

It involves studying thousands of individuals, often from different populations, with exacting techniques. The scale and complexity of such research has required the formation of research consortia. Members of these consortia need to agree on policies for managing shared resources and handling genetic data. Here we consider data-sharing and intellectual property policies for an international research consortium working on the genomic epidemiology of malaria. We outline specific guidelines governing how samples and data are transferred among its members; how results are released into the public domain; when to seek protection for intellectual property; and how intellectual property should be managed. We outline some pragmatic solutions founded on the basic principles of promoting innovation and access.</p>

It is unclear how different combinations of histone modification coordinate regimes of transcription during development. We show that different methylation states of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) mark distinct developmental phases of the simple eukaryote, Dictyostelium. We demonstrate that the enzyme responsible for all mono, di and tri-methylation of H3K4 is the Dictyostelium homolog of the Set1 histone methyltransferase. In the absence of Set1, cells display unusually rapid development, characterized by precocious aggregation of amoebae into multicellular aggregates. Early differentiation markers are abundantly expressed in growing set1 cells, indicating the differentiation program is ectopically activated during growth. This phenotype is caused specifically by the loss of Set1 catalytic activity. Set1 mutants induce premature differentiation in wild-type cells, indicating Set1 regulates production of an extra-cellular factor required for the correct perception of growth conditions. Microarray analysis of the set1 mutants reveals genomic clustering of mis-expressed genes, suggesting a requirement for Set1 in the regulation of chromatin-mediated events at gene clusters.</p>

The 2.13-Mb genome was shown by sequencing to comprise a 1.83 Mb chromosome, a 242-kb megaplasmid (pMP118), and two smaller plasmids. Megaplasmids previously have not been characterized in lactic acid bacteria or intestinal lactobacilli. Annotation of the genome sequence indicated an intermediate level of auxotrophy compared with other sequenced lactobacilli. No single-copy essential genes were located on the megaplasmid. However, contingency amino acid metabolism genes and carbohydrate utilization genes, including two genes for completion of the pentose phosphate pathway, were megaplasmid encoded. The megaplasmid also harbored genes for the Abp118 bacteriocin, a bile salt hydrolase, a presumptive conjugation locus, and other genes potentially relevant for probiotic properties. Two subspecies of L. salivarius are recognized, salivarius and salicinius, and we detected megaplasmids in both subspecies by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of sizes ranging from 100 kb to 380 kb. The discovery of megaplasmids of widely varying size in L. salivarius suggests a possible mechanism for genome expansion or contraction to adapt to different environments.</p>

Among the findings has been a unique organisation for the tRNA genes in this organism. Forty-two of the tRNA isoacceptor types are encoded in tandem arrays that vary in unit length from 490 to 1775 basepairs and contain from 1 to 5 tRNA genes. In three cases a 5S RNA gene is also present in the unit. An estimated 10% of the genome is made up of these arrays. Interspersed between RNA-encoding sequences are short tandem repeats that are polymorphic between isolates and, in some cases, within isolates. The number and organisation of tRNA genes in E. histolytica is unprecedented. In addition to encoding the tRNAs of the organism we propose that the arrays may fulfil a structural role in the genome.</p>

We have identified 698 proteins from the postsynaptic terminal of mouse CNS synapses using a series of purification strategies and analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and large-scale immunoblotting. Some 620 proteins were found in purified postsynaptic densities (PSDs), nine in AMPA-receptor immuno-purifications, 100 in isolates using an antibody against the NMDA receptor subunit NR1, and 170 by peptide-affinity purification of complexes with the C-terminus of NR2B. Together, the NR1 and NR2B complexes contain 186 proteins, collectively referred to as membrane-associated guanylate kinase-associated signalling complexes. We extracted data from six other synapse proteome experiments and combined these with our data to provide a consensus on the composition of the PSP. In total, 1124 proteins are present in the PSP, of which 466 were validated by their detection in two or more studies, forming what we have designated the Consensus PSD. These synapse proteome data sets offer a basis for future research in synaptic biology and will provide useful information in brain disease and mental disorder studies.</p>

Here we report a new method that uses SNP genotype data from parent-offspring trios to identify polymorphic deletions. We applied this method to data from the International HapMap Project to produce the first high-resolution population surveys of deletion polymorphism. Approximately 100 of these deletions have been experimentally validated using comparative genome hybridization on tiling-resolution oligonucleotide microarrays. Our analysis identifies a total of 586 distinct regions that harbor deletion polymorphisms in one or more of the families. Notably, we estimate that typical individuals are hemizygous for roughly 30-50 deletions larger than 5 kb, totaling around 550-750 kb of euchromatic sequence across their genomes. The detected deletions span a total of 267 known and predicted genes. Overall, however, the deleted regions are relatively gene-poor, consistent with the action of purifying selection against deletions. Deletion polymorphisms may well have an important role in the genetics of complex traits; however, they are not directly observed in most current gene mapping studies. Our new method will permit the identification of deletion polymorphisms in high-density SNP surveys of trio or other family data.</p>

In an initial 50-kb marker map (580 markers) across the linked region, one of the two strongest associations observed in Utah Caucasians was at marker rs1503814 (P &lt; 0.00001 in pools, P &lt; 0.004 in individuals). Based on this association, we typed additional markers and screened for sequence variation in the nearby DUSP12 gene. The strongest associations mapped to a highly conserved nongenic sequence just telomeric to rs1503814 and extended 10 kb telomeric through the DUSP12 gene and into the 5&#39; end of the adjacent ATF6 gene. No coding variant could explain the association in the DUSP12 gene. An extended haplotype encompassing markers from -8,379 to +10,309 bp relative to the ATG start was more common in Caucasian case (0.381) than control subjects (0.285, P = 0.005) and was uniquely tagged by a 194-bp allele at either of two simple tandem repeat variants or by the T allele at marker +7,580. Markers -8,379 and +7,580 were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in African-American subjects (P &lt; 0.05), but with different alleles. Marker rs1503814 was strongly associated with postchallenge insulin levels among family members (P = 0.000002), but sequence variation in this region was not associated with type 2 diabetes in three other populations of European ancestry. Our data suggest that sequences in or upstream of DUSP12 may contribute to type 2 diabetes susceptibility, but the lack of replication suggests a small effect size.</p>

Our optimized CSCE protocol detected 93 of 95 known base substitution sequence variants. Since the optimization of the method, we have analyzed 215 Mb of DNA and identified 3397 unique variants. An analysis of this data set indicates that the sensitivity of CSCE is above 95% in the central 56% of the average PCR product. To fully exploit the mutation detection capacity of this method, we have developed software, canplot, which automatically compares normal and test results to prioritize samples that are most likely to contain variants. Using multiple fluorescent dyes, CSCE has the capacity to screen over 2.2 Mb on one ABI3730 each day. Therefore this technique is suitable for projects where a rapid and sensitive DNA mutation detection system is required.</p>

HLA variation is a crucial determinant of transplant rejection and susceptibility to a large number of infectious and autoimmune diseases. Yet identification of causal variants is problematic owing to linkage disequilibrium that extends across multiple HLA and non-HLA genes in the MHC. We therefore set out to characterize the linkage disequilibrium patterns between the highly polymorphic HLA genes and background variation by typing the classical HLA genes and &gt;7,500 common SNPs and deletion-insertion polymorphisms across four population samples. The analysis provides informative tag SNPs that capture much of the common variation in the MHC region and that could be used in disease association studies, and it provides new insight into the evolutionary dynamics and ancestral origins of the HLA loci and their haplotypes.</p>

Here we analysed approximately 13,000 ESTs derived from the erythrocytic stage of the apicomplexan parasite Babesia bovis. The ESTs were clustered in order to obtain information on the expression level of a gene and to increase sequence length and reliability. A total of 3522 clusters were obtained and annotated using BLAST algorithms. The clusters were estimated to represent approximately 2600 genes of which in total approximately 2.1 Mbp sequence information was obtained. Expression levels of the genes, as determined by the numbers of ESTs contained within a cluster, were compared to those of their closest homologs in the erythrocytic stage of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. Pathways that are represented relatively abundant in B. bovis are, amongst others, the purine salvage pathway (displaying characteristics not identified before in apicomplexans), isoprenoid biosynthesis in the apicoplast and many genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Especially remarkable in the latter group are the F-type ATPases - which are hardly expressed in P. falciparum and T. gondii - and two highly expressed glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases creating a shuttle possibly controlling the cytoplasmic NADH/NAD+ -ratio. A comparison of known antigenic proteins from Australian and American strains of B. bovis with the Israel strain used here identifies considerable sequence variation in the rhoptry associated protein-1 (RAP-1), merozoite surface proteins of the variable merozoite surface antigen (VMSA) family and spherical body proteins. Analysis of the EST clusters representing the variable erythocyte surface antigen family reveals many variant transcripts of which a few are dominant. Two putative pseudogenes also seem to be transcribed at high levels.</p>

Historically, it has been subdivided into three regions (Class I, II, and III), but a cluster of functionally related genes within the Class III region has also been referred to as the Class IV region or &quot;inflammatory region&quot;. This group of genes is involved in the inflammatory response, and includes members of the tumour necrosis family. Here we report the sequencing, annotation and comparative analysis of a tammar wallaby BAC containing the inflammatory region. We also discuss the extent of sequence conservation across the entire region and identify elements conserved in evolution.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: Fourteen Class III genes from the tammar wallaby inflammatory region were characterised and compared to their orthologues in other vertebrates. The organisation and sequence of genes in the inflammatory region of both the wallaby and South American opossum are highly conserved compared to known genes from eutherian (&quot;placental&quot;) mammals. Some minor differences separate the two marsupial species. Eight genes within the inflammatory region have remained tightly clustered for at least 360 million years, predating the divergence of the amphibian lineage. Analysis of sequence conservation identified 354 elements that are conserved. These range in size from 7 to 431 bases and cover 15.6% of the inflammatory region, representing approximately a 4-fold increase compared to the average for vertebrate genomes. About 5.5% of this conserved sequence is marsupial-specific, including three cases of marsupial-specific repeats. Highly Conserved Elements were also characterised.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Using comparative analysis, we show that a cluster of MHC genes involved in inflammation, including TNF, LTA (or its putative teleost homolog TNF-N), APOM, and BAT3 have remained together for over 450 million years, predating the divergence of mammals from fish. The observed enrichment in conserved sequences within the inflammatory region suggests conservation at the transcriptional regulatory level, in addition to the functional level.</p>

Our analyses revealed putative proteins involved in the barrier function of the gut (peritrophins, microvillar proteins, glutamine synthase), digestive physiology (secreted and membrane-anchored hydrolytic enzymes), and the immune response (gram-negative binding proteins, thioester proteins, scavenger receptors, galectins, signaling pathway factors, caspases, serpins, and peroxidases).

Here, we show that in Staphylococcus aureus the luxS gene forms a monocistronic transcriptional unit under the control of a sigma(70)-dependent promoter. The gene was transcribed throughout growth under a variety of conditions, including intracellular growth in MAC-T cells. AI-2 was produced in rich media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, peaking during the transition to stationary phase, but was hardly detectable in a sulfur-limited defined medium. In the presence of glucose or under anaerobic conditions, cultures retained considerable AI-2 activity after entry into stationary phase. Inactivation of luxS in various S. aureus strains did not affect virulence-associated traits, such as production of hemolysins and extracellular proteases, biofilm formation, and the agr signaling system. Conversely, AI-2 production remained unchanged in an agr mutant. However, luxS mutants grown in a sulfur-limited defined medium exhibited a growth defect. When grown together with the wild type in mixed culture, luxS mutants of various S. aureus strains showed reduced ability to compete for growth under these conditions. In contrast, a complemented luxS mutant grew as well as the parent strain, suggesting that the observed growth defect was of an intracellular nature and had not been caused by either second-site mutations or the lack of a diffusible factor. However, the LuxS/AI-2 system does not appear to contribute to the overall fitness of S. aureus RN6390B during intracellular growth in epithelial cells: the wild type and a luxS mutant showed very similar growth patterns after their internalization by MAC-T cells.</p>

Approximately 3% of noncoding sequence is conserved among distantly related mammals, suggesting that these evolutionarily conserved noncoding regions (CNCs) are selectively constrained and contain functional variation. However, CNCs could also merely represent regions with lower local mutation rates. Here we address this issue and show that CNCs are selectively constrained in humans by analyzing HapMap genotype data. Specifically, new (derived) alleles of SNPs within CNCs are rarer than new alleles in nonconserved regions (P = 3 x 10(-18)), indicating that evolutionary pressure has suppressed CNC-derived allele frequencies. Intronic CNCs and CNCs near genes show greater allele frequency shifts, with magnitudes comparable to those for missense variants. Thus, conserved noncoding variants are more likely to be functional. Allele frequency distributions highlight selectively constrained genomic regions that should be intensively surveyed for functionally important variation.</p>

We previously showed that an AraC homologue designated AggR is required for the expression of plasmid-encoded genes that mediate AA of EAEC strain 042. In this study, we hypothesized that AggR also controls the expression of other virulence determinants in EAEC 042. Using proteomic and microarray analysis, we identified for the first time that AggR activates the expression of chromosomal genes, including 25 contiguous genes (aaiA-Y), which are localized to a 117 kb pathogenicity island (PAI) inserted at pheU. Many of these genes have homologues in other Gram-negative bacteria and were recently proposed to constitute a type VI secretion system (T6SS). AaiC was identified as a secreted protein that has no apparent homologues within GenBank. EAEC strains carrying in-frame deletions of aaiB, aaiG, aaiO or aaiP still synthesized AaiC; however, AaiC secretion was abolished. Cloning of aai genes into E. coli HB101 suggested that aaiA-P are sufficient for AaiC secretion. A second T6SS was identified within the pheU PAI that secretes a protein unrelated by sequence identity to AaiC. Distribution studies indicated that aaiA and aaiC are commonly found in EAEC isolates worldwide, particularly in strains defined as typical EAEC. These data support the hypothesis that AggR is a global regulator of EAEC virulence determinants, and builds on the hypothesis that T6SS is an importance mediator of pathogenesis.</p>

We examined the performance of Widal test in a community field site and compared it with Typhidot and Tubex tests for diagnosis of typhoid fever. Blood samples were collected from 6697 patients with fever for &gt; or =3 days for microscopy, culture, and serologic testing and from randomly selected 172 consenting healthy individuals to assess the baseline Widal anti-Typhi O lipopolysaccharide antibody (anti-TO) and anti-Typhi H flagellar antibody (anti-TH) titers. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the 3 serologic tests were calculated using culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases as &quot;true positives&quot; and paratyphoid fever and malaria cases as &quot;true negatives&quot;. Comparing cutoff values for the Widal test, an anti-TO titer of 1/80 was optimal with 58% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 69% PPV, and 77% NPV. Sensitivity was increased to 67% when the Widal test was done on the 5th day of illness and thereafter. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of Typhidot and Tubex were not better than Widal test. There is a need for more efficient rapid diagnostic test for typhoid fever especially during the acute stage of the disease. Until then, culture remains the method of choice.</p>

Using bisulfite DNA sequencing, we report high-resolution methylation profiles of human chromosomes 6, 20 and 22, providing a resource of about 1.9 million CpG methylation values derived from 12 different tissues. Analysis of six annotation categories showed that evolutionarily conserved regions are the predominant sites for differential DNA methylation and that a core region surrounding the transcriptional start site is an informative surrogate for promoter methylation. We find that 17% of the 873 analyzed genes are differentially methylated in their 5&#39; UTRs and that about one-third of the differentially methylated 5&#39; UTRs are inversely correlated with transcription. Despite the fact that our study controlled for factors reported to affect DNA methylation such as sex and age, we did not find any significant attributable effects. Our data suggest DNA methylation to be ontogenetically more stable than previously thought.</p>

Since then, there have been over 11,000 mutations in the three RAS (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) genes in codons 12, 13 and 61 reported in the literature. We report here the identification of recurrent somatic missense mutations at alanine 146, a highly conserved residue in the guanine nucleotide binding domain. In two independent series of colorectal cancers from Hong Kong and the United States we detected KRAS A146 mutations in 7/126 and 2/94 cases, respectively, giving a combined frequency of 4%. We also detected KRAS A146 mutations in 2/40 (5%) colorectal cell lines, including the NCI-60 colorectal cancer line HCC2998. Codon 146 mutations thus are likely to make an equal or greater contribution to colorectal cancer than codon 61 mutations (4.2% in our combined series, 1% in the literature). Lung adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas did not show codon 146 mutations. We did, however, identify a KRAS A146 mutation in the ML-2 acute myeloid leukemia cell line and an NRAS A146 mutation in the NALM-6 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line, suggesting that the contribution of codon 146 mutations is not entirely restricted to colorectal cancers or to KRAS.</p>

However, proteins that cluster AMPA-Rs at synapses remain poorly understood. Here we show that PSD-95-like membrane-associated guanylate kinases (PSD-MAGUKs) mediate this synaptic targeting, and we uncover a remarkable functional redundancy within this protein family. By manipulating endogenous neuronal PSD-MAGUK levels, we find that both PSD-95 and PSD-93 independently mediate AMPA-R targeting at mature synapses. We also reveal unanticipated synapse heterogeneity as loss of either PSD-95 or PSD-93 silences largely nonoverlapping populations of excitatory synapses. In adult PSD-95 and PSD-93 double knockout animals, SAP-102 is upregulated and compensates for the loss of synaptic AMPA-Rs. At immature synapses, PSD-95 and PSD-93 play little role in synaptic AMPA-R clustering; instead, SAP-102 dominates. These studies establish a PSD-MAGUK-specific regulation of AMPA-R synaptic expression that establishes and maintains glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Audiovestibular Genomics Group, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB1O ISA, UK.</p><p class="abstract">For over 100 years after the first description of the disorder, the molecular pathology underlying the deafness and thyroid pathology in Pendred syndrome (PS) remained unknown. In 1997, early progress towards understanding the molecular basis of the disorder was made when we identified the PS gene and found it to belong to the SLC26 family of anion transporters. The realization that an anion transporter was responsible for these clinical features soon highlighted a potential role for pendrin in thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The role of pendrin in deafness, however, remained unclear. Our determination of its expression pattern in the inner ear along with the development of a mouse with a targeted disruption of the Slc26a4 gene has revealed that Slc26a4 is expressed in areas of the endolymphatic compartment known to play a role in endolymph reabsorption and that absence of this protein leads to a profound prenatal endolymphatic hydrops and destruction of many of the epithelial cells surrounding the scala media. The precise mechanisms underlying endolymph reabsorption in the inner ear are not yet known; these studies, however, provide some of the groundwork for allowing the future delineation of these processes.</p>

Here, we present an extraordinary case in which both mother and daughter presented with unexpected chromosomal rearrangement complexity, which we characterized with array-CGH, array painting and multicolor large insert clone hybridizations. We found the same 12 breakpoints involving four chromosomes in both mother and daughter. In addition, the daughter inherited a microdeletion from her father. We mapped all breakpoints to the resolution level of breakpoint spanning clones. Genes were found within 7 of the 12 breakpoint regions, some of which were disrupted by the chromosome rearrangement. One of the rearrangements disrupted a locus, which has been discussed as a quantitative trait locus for fetal hemoglobin expression in adults. Interestingly, both mother and daughter show persistent fetal hemoglobin levels. We detail the most complicated familial complex chromosomal rearrangement reported to date and thus an extreme example of inheritance of chromosomal rearrangements without error in meiotic segregation.</p>

The majority of arthropod Wolbachia belong to clades A and B, while nematode Wolbachia mostly belong to clades C and D, but these relationships have been based on analysis of a small number of genes. To investigate the evolution and relationships of Wolbachia symbionts we have sequenced over 70 kb of the genome of wOvo, a Wolbachia from the human-parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus, and compared the genes identified to orthologues in other sequenced Wolbachia genomes. In comparisons of conserved local synteny, we find that wBm, from the nematode Brugia malayi, and wMel, from Drosophila melanogaster, are more similar to each other than either is to wOvo. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes on the sequenced fragments supports reciprocal monophyly of nematode and arthropod Wolbachia. The nematode Wolbachia did not arise from within the A clade of arthropod Wolbachia, and the root of the Wolbachia clade lies between the nematode and arthropod symbionts. Using the wOvo sequence, we identified a lateral transfer event whereby segments of the Wolbachia genome were inserted into the Onchocerca nuclear genome. This event predated the separation of the human parasite O. volvulus from its cattle-parasitic sister species, O. ochengi. The long association between filarial nematodes and Wolbachia symbionts may permit more frequent genetic exchange between their genomes.</p>

We have constructed a large-insert clone DNA microarray covering the entire human genome in tiling path resolution that we have used to identify copy number variation in human populations. Crucial to this study has been the development of a robust array platform and analytic process for the automated identification of copy number variants (CNVs). The array consists of 26,574 clones covering 93.7% of euchromatic regions. Clones were selected primarily from the published &quot;Golden Path,&quot; and mapping was confirmed by fingerprinting and BAC-end sequencing. Array performance was extensively tested by a series of validation assays. These included determining the hybridization characteristics of each individual clone on the array by chromosome-specific add-in experiments. Estimation of data reproducibility and false-positive/negative rates was carried out using self-self hybridizations, replicate experiments, and independent validations of CNVs. Based on these studies, we developed a variance-based automatic copy number detection analysis process (CNVfinder) and have demonstrated its robustness by comparison with the SW-ARRAY method.</p>

Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of plants and algae are believed to share a common ancestor and the modern chloroplast would thus be the remnant of an endosymbiosis between a eukaryotic cell and an ancestral oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryote. Chloroplast metabolic processes are coordinated with those of the other cellular compartments and are strictly controlled by means of regulatory systems that commonly involve redox reactions. Disulphide/dithiol exchange catalysed by thioredoxin is a fundamental example of such regulation and represents the molecular mechanism for light-dependent redox control of an ever-increasing number of chloroplast enzymatic activities. In contrast to chloroplast thioredoxins, the functions of the cyanobacterial thioredoxins have long remained elusive, despite their common origin. The sequenced genomes of several cyanobacterial species together with novel experimental approaches involving proteomics have provided new tools for re-examining the roles of the thioredoxin systems in these organisms. Thus, each cyanobacterial genome encodes between one and eight thioredoxins and all components necessary for the reduction of thioredoxins. Screening for thioredoxin target proteins in cyanobacteria indicates that assimilation and storage of nutrients, as well as some central metabolic pathways, are regulated by mechanisms involving disulphide/dithiol exchange, which could be catalysed by thioredoxins or related thiol-containing proteins.</p>

Hypersensitivity of cis-regulatory elements to digestion with DNaseI remains the gold-standard approach to locating such elements. Traditional methods used to identify DNaseI hypersensitive sites are cumbersome and can only be applied to short stretches of DNA at defined locations. Here we report the development of a novel genomic array-based approach to DNaseI hypersensitive site mapping (ADHM) that permits precise, large-scale identification of such sites from as few as 5 million cells. Using ADHM we identified all previously recognized hematopoietic regulatory elements across 200 kb of the mouse T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (Tal1) locus, and, in addition, identified two novel elements within the locus, which show transcriptional regulatory activity. We further validated the ADHM protocol by mapping the DNaseI hypersensitive sites across 250 kb of the human TAL1 locus in CD34+ primary stem/progenitor cells and K562 cells and by mapping the previously known DNaseI hypersensitive sites across 240 kb of the human alpha-globin locus in K562 cells. ADHM provides a powerful approach to identifying DNaseI hypersensitive sites across large genomic regions.</p>

In addition, there is data from the systematic sequencing of 518 protein kinase genes. The total gene count in COSMIC stands at 538; 25 have a mutation frequency above 5% in one or more tumour type, no mutations were found in 333 genes and 180 are rarely mutated with frequencies &lt;5% in any tumour set. The COSMIC web site has been expanded to give more views and summaries of the data and provide faster query routes and downloads.

Although our understanding of the extent of this variation is still developing, it seems likely that, at least in humans, copy number variants (CNVs) account for a substantial amount of genetic variation. Since many CNVs include genes that result in differential levels of gene expression, CNVs may account for a significant proportion of normal phenotypic variation. Current efforts are directed toward a more comprehensive cataloging and characterization of CNVs that will provide the basis for determining how genomic diversity impacts biological function, evolution, and common human diseases.</p>

In analogy with pseudogenes, we define pseudo-messenger RNA to be RNA molecules that resemble protein-coding mRNA, but cannot encode full-length proteins owing to disruptions of the reading frame. Using a rigorous computational pipeline, which rules out sequencing errors, we identify 10,679 pseudo-messenger RNAs (approximately half of which are transposon-associated) among the 102,801 FANTOM3 mouse cDNAs: just over 10% of the FANTOM3 transcriptome. These comprise not only transcribed pseudogenes, but also disrupted splice variants of otherwise protein-coding genes. Some may encode truncated proteins, only a minority of which appear subject to nonsense-mediated decay. The presence of an excess of transcripts whose only disruptions are opal stop codons suggests that there are more selenoproteins than currently estimated. We also describe compensatory frameshifts, where a segment of the gene has changed frame but remains translatable. In summary, we survey a large class of non-standard but potentially functional transcripts that are likely to encode genetic information and effect biological processes in novel ways. Many of these transcripts do not correspond cleanly to any identifiable object in the genome, implying fundamental limits to the goal of annotating all functional elements at the genome sequence level.</p>

We investigated colorectal cancer cell lines using array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for copy number changes and single-copy number polymorphism (SNP) microarrays for allelic loss (LOH). Many array-based CGH changes were not found by LOH because they did not cause true reduction-to-homozygosity. Conversely, many regions of SNP-LOH occurred in the absence of copy number change, comprising an average per cell line of 2 chromosomes with complete LOH; 1-2 terminal regions of LOH (mitotic recombination); and 1 interstitial region of LOH. SNP-LOH detected many novel changes, representing possible locations of uncharacterized tumor suppressor loci. Microsatellite unstable (MSI+) lines infrequently showed gains/deletions or whole-chromosome LOH, but their near-diploid karyotypes concealed mitotic recombination frequencies similar to those of MSI- lines. We analyzed p53 and chromosome 18q (SMAD4) in detail, including mutation screening. Almost all MSI- lines showed LOH and/or deletion of p53 and 18q; some near-triploid lines had acquired three independent changes at these loci. We found consistent results in primary colorectal cancers. Overall, the distributions of mitotic recombination and whole-chromosome LOH in the MSI- cell lines differed significantly from random, with some lines having much higher than expected levels of these changes. Moreover, lines with more LOH changes had significantly fewer copy number changes. These data suggest that CIN is not synonymous with copy number change and some cancers have a specific tendency to whole-chromosome deletion and regain or to mitotic recombination.</p>

Zebrafish miR-430 is expressed at the onset of zygotic transcription and regulates morphogenesis during early development. By using a microarray approach and in vivo target validation, we find that miR-430 directly regulates several hundred target messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs). Most targets are maternally expressed mRNAs that accumulate in the absence of miR-430. We also show that miR-430 accelerates the deadenylation of target mRNAs. These results suggest that miR-430 facilitates the deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs during early embryogenesis.</p>

In our forward genetic screen, we have uncovered 77 candidate phenotypes in diverse organogenesis and differentiation processes. Using a gynogenetic screen design, which minimizes time and husbandry space expenditures, we find that if a phenotype is detected in the gynogenetic F2 of a given F1 female twice, it is highly likely to be a heritable abnormality (29/29 cases). We have also demonstrated the feasibility of reverse genetic approaches for obtaining carriers of mutations in specific genes, and have directly determined an induced mutation rate by sequencing specific exons from a mutagenized population. The Xenopus system, with its well-understood embryology, fate map, and gain-of-function approaches, can now be coupled with efficient loss-of-function genetic strategies for vertebrate functional genomics and developmental genetics.</p>

Genotyping efficiency can be increased by choosing tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) in LD with other SNPs. However, it remains to be seen whether tagSNPs defined in one population efficiently capture LD in other populations; that is, how portable tagSNPs are. Indeed, tagSNP portability is a challenge for the applicability of HapMap results. We analyzed 144 SNPs in a 1-Mb region of chromosome 22 in 1055 individuals from 38 worldwide populations, classified into seven continental groups. We measured tagSNP portability by choosing three reference populations (to approximate the three HapMap populations), defining tagSNPs, and applying them to other populations independently on the availability of information on the tagSNPs in the compared population. We found that tagSNPs are highly informative in other populations within each continental group. Moreover, tagSNPs defined in Europeans are often efficient for Middle Eastern and Central/South Asian populations. TagSNPs defined in the three reference populations are also efficient for more distant and differentiated populations (Oceania, Americas), in which the impact of their special demographic history on the genetic structure does not interfere with successfully detecting the most common haplotype variation. This high degree of portability lends promise to the search for disease association in different populations, once tagSNPs are defined in a few reference populations like those analyzed in the HapMap initiative.</p>

Here, we show that genetic ablation of geminin in the mouse prevents formation of inner cell mass (ICM) and causes premature endoreduplication at eight cells, rather than 32 cells. All cells in geminin-deficient embryos commit to the trophoblast cell lineage and consist of trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) only. Geminin is also down-regulated in TGCs of wild-type blastocysts during S and gap-like phases by proteasome-mediated degradation, suggesting that loss of geminin is part of the mechanism regulating endoreduplication.</p>

We now have the first draft picture of the synapse, comprising approximately 1000 proteins. This is not matched by available methods of functional analysis either in reduced systems or in whole animals. Fewer than 20% of synapse proteome proteins have a known function in the nervous system. A concerted effort is required to establish new technical approaches before we can understand the diversity of functions conferred by the synapse proteome on the synapse, the neuron and the animal. This review will highlight this change in knowledge and discuss current technical and interpretative limitations challenged by synapse proteomics.</p>

These somatic mutations most likely include passenger mutations that are not cancer causing and pathogenic driver mutations in cancer genes. Establishing a significant presence of driver mutations in such data sets is of biological interest. Whereas current techniques from phylogeny are applicable to large data sets composed of singly mutated samples, recently exemplified with a p53 mutation database, methods for smaller data sets containing individual samples with multiple mutations need to be developed. By constructing distinct models of both the mutation process and selection pressure upon the cancer samples, exact statistical tests to examine this problem are devised. Tests to examine the significance of selection toward missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations are derived, along with tests assessing variation in selection between functional domains. Maximum-likelihood methods facilitate parameter estimation, including levels of selection pressure and minimum numbers of pathogenic mutations. These methods are illustrated with 25 breast cancers screened across the coding sequences of 518 kinase genes, revealing 90 base substitutions in 71 genes. Significant selection pressure upon truncating mutations was established. Furthermore, an estimated minimum of 29.8 mutations were pathogenic.</p>

Rearrangements and mutations of chromosome 1 are prevalent in cancer and many other diseases. Patterns of sequence variation reveal signals of recent selection in specific genes that may contribute to human fitness, and also in regions where no function is evident. Fine-scale recombination occurs in hotspots of varying intensity along the sequence, and is enriched near genes.

The experiment had two major goals: the assessment of the accuracy of computational methods to predict protein coding genes; and the overall assessment of the completeness of the current human genome annotations as represented in the ENCODE regions. For the computational prediction assessment, eighteen groups contributed gene predictions. We evaluated these submissions against each other based on a &#39;reference set&#39; of annotations generated as part of the GENCODE project. These annotations were not available to the prediction groups prior to the submission deadline, so that their predictions were blind and an external advisory committee could perform a fair assessment.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: The best methods had at least one gene transcript correctly predicted for close to 70% of the annotated genes. Nevertheless, the multiple transcript accuracy, taking into account alternative splicing, reached only approximately 40% to 50% accuracy. At the coding nucleotide level, the best programs reached an accuracy of 90% in both sensitivity and specificity. Programs relying on mRNA and protein sequences were the most accurate in reproducing the manually curated annotations. Experimental validation shows that only a very small percentage (3.2%) of the selected 221 computationally predicted exons outside of the existing annotation could be verified.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first such experiment in human DNA, and we have followed the standards established in a similar experiment, GASP1, in Drosophila melanogaster. We believe the results presented here contribute to the value of ongoing large-scale annotation projects and should guide further experimental methods when being scaled up to the entire human genome sequence.</p>

By the end of the tenth century, Central Asian Muslims moved into India from the northwest and expanded throughout the subcontinent. Muslim communities are now the largest minority religion in India, comprising more than 138 million people in a predominantly Hindu population of over one billion. It is unclear whether the Muslim expansion in India was a purely cultural phenomenon or had a genetic impact on the local population. To address this question from a male perspective, we typed eight microsatellite loci and 16 binary markers from the Y chromosome in 246 Muslims from Andhra Pradesh, and compared them to published data on 4,204 males from East Asia, Central Asia, other parts of India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, the Middle East, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco. We find that the Muslim populations in general are genetically closer to their non-Muslim geographical neighbors than to other Muslims in India, and that there is a highly significant correlation between genetics and geography (but not religion). Our findings indicate that, despite the documented practice of marriage between Muslim men and Hindu women, Islamization in India did not involve large-scale replacement of Hindu Y chromosomes. The Muslim expansion in India was predominantly a cultural change and was not accompanied by significant gene flow, as seen in other places, such as China and Central Asia.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Institute of Genetics, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Berne, Bremgartenstrasse 109a, 3001 Berne, Switzerland.</p><p class="abstract">The human gene deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) is considered to play a role in tumorigenesis and pathogen defense. It encodes a protein with multiple scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are involved in recognition and binding of a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. The SRCR domains are encoded by highly homologous repetitive exons, whose number in humans may vary from 8 to 13 due to genetic polymorphism. Here, we characterized the porcine DMBT1 gene on the mRNA and genomic level. We assembled a 4.5 kb porcine DMBT1 cDNA sequence from RT-PCR amplified seminal vesicle RNA. The porcine DMBT1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 4050 nt. The transcript gives rise to a putative polypeptide of 1349 amino acids with a calculated mass of 147.9 kDa. Compared to human DMBT1, it contains only four N-terminal SRCR domains. Northern blotting revealed transcripts of approximately 4.7 kb in size in the tissues analyzed. Analysis of ESTs suggested the existence of secreted and transmembrane variants. The porcine DMBT1 gene spans about 54 kb on chromosome 14q28-q29. In contrast to the characterized cDNA, the genomic BAC clone only contained 3 exons coding for N-terminal SRCR domains. In different mammalian DMBT1 orthologs large interspecific differences in the number of SRCR exons and utilization of the transmembrane exon exist. Our data suggest that the porcine DMBT1 gene may share with the human DMBT1 gene additional intraspecific variations in the number of SRCR-coding exons.</p>

<p class="authors"><span class="author">Hajarnavis A</span> and <span class="author">Durbin R</span></p><p class="abstract">The 3&#39; untranslated regions (3&#39; UTR) of eukaryotic genes can contain motifs involved in regulation of gene expression or localization at the post-transcriptional level. This study concerns the identification of novel, conserved elements in 3&#39; UTRs of many ribosomal protein mRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. Analysis of the region around the polyadenylation signal in many ribosomal protein mRNAs indicates the conservation of a sequence motif UUGUU occurring both before and immediately after the polyadenylation signal. Building a statistical model of this motif and searching a database of C. elegans 3&#39; UTRs reveals that this motif is also present in the 3&#39; UTR of some genes involved in translation and ribosome maturation, among others. We suggest that this signal may be involved in translation or other message-level regulation of ribosomal genes in C. elegans.</p>

The d-tartrate non-fermenting variant S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi B dT- (S. Paratyphi B) is the causative agent of paratyphoid fever, and the d-tartrate fermenting variant S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (S. Paratyphi B dT+; formerly called Salmonella Java) causes gastroenteritis. S. Java is currently recognized as an emerging problem worldwide. Twelve dT+ S. Java isolates were collected in Indonesia between 2000 and 2002. One-third of them contained Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), which gives the multidrug-resistant phenotype to the bacteria. In this study, a PCR-based method to detect a single nucleotide difference responsible for the inability to ferment d-tartrate, reported elsewhere, was validated. The d-tartrate fermenting phenotype of S. Java was converted to the non-fermenting phenotype by the disruption of the ORF STM 3356, and the d-tartrate non-fermenting phenotype of the ORF STM 3356-disrupted strain and the dT- reference strain was changed to the dT+ phenotype by complementing ORF STM 3356 in trans. The results show that the dT+ phenotype requires a functional product encoded by STM 3356, and support the use of the PCR-based discrimination method for S. Paratyphi B and S. Java as the standard differentiation method.</p>

Here, we identify 401 strong origins and 503 putative weaker origins spaced in total every 14 kb throughout the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The same origins are used during premeiotic and mitotic S-phases. We found that few origins fire late in mitotic S-phase and that activating the Rad3 dependent S-phase checkpoint by inhibiting DNA replication had little effect on which origins were fired. A genome-wide analysis of eukaryotic origin efficiencies showed that efficiency was variable, with large chromosomal domains enriched for efficient or inefficient origins. Average efficiency is twice as high during mitosis compared with meiosis, which can account for their different S-phase lengths. We conclude that there is a continuum of origin efficiency and that there is differential origin activity in the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles.</p>

Previous mouse mutagenesis screens for lethal mutations were targeted at specific time points or for developmental processes. Here we present the results of lethal mutant isolation from two mutagenesis screens that use balancer chromosomes. One screen was localized to mouse chromosome 4, between the STS markers D4Mit281 and D4Mit51. The second screen covered the region between Trp53 and Wnt3 on mouse chromosome 11. These screens identified all lethal mutations in the balancer regions, without bias towards any phenotype or stage of death. We have isolated 19 lethal lines on mouse chromosome 4, and 59 lethal lines on chromosome 11, many of which are distinct from previous mutants that map to these regions of the genome. We have characterized the mutant lines to determine the time of death, and performed a pair-wise complementation cross to determine if the mutations are allelic. Our data suggest that the majority of mouse lethal mutations die during mid-gestation, after uterine implantation, with a variety of defects in gastrulation, heart, neural tube, vascular, or placental development. This initial group of mutants provides a functional annotation of mouse chromosomes 4 and 11, and indicates that many novel developmental phenotypes can be quickly isolated in defined genomic intervals through balancer chromosome mutagenesis screens.</p>

<p class="authors"><span class="author">Honeybee Genome Sequencing Consortium</span></p><p class="abstract">Here we report the genome sequence of the honeybee Apis mellifera, a key model for social behaviour and essential to global ecology through pollination. Compared with other sequenced insect genomes, the A. mellifera genome has high A+T and CpG contents, lacks major transposon families, evolves more slowly, and is more similar to vertebrates for circadian rhythm, RNA interference and DNA methylation genes, among others. Furthermore, A. mellifera has fewer genes for innate immunity, detoxification enzymes, cuticle-forming proteins and gustatory receptors, more genes for odorant receptors, and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, consistent with its ecology and social organization. Compared to Drosophila, genes in early developmental pathways differ in Apis, whereas similarities exist for functions that differ markedly, such as sex determination, brain function and behaviour. Population genetics suggests a novel African origin for the species A. mellifera and insights into whether Africanized bees spread throughout the New World via hybridization or displacement.</p>

Thirty-three homologous autosomal segments were detected in genomes of sika deer and red deer, while 31 autosomal homologous segments were delineated in genome of tufted deer. The Chinese muntjac chromosome X probe painted to the whole X chromosome, and the chromosome Y probe gave signals on the Y chromosome as well as distal region of the X chromosome of each species. Our results confirmed that exclusive Robertsonian translocations have contributed to the karyotypic evolution of sika deer and red deer. In addition to Robertsonian translocation, tandem fusions have played a more important role in the karyotypic evolution of tufted deer. Different types of chromosomal rearrangements have led to great differences in the genome organization between cervinae and muntiacinae species. Our analysis testified that six chromosomal fissions in the proposed 2n = 58 ancestral pecoran karyotype led to the formation of 2n = 70 ancestral cervid karyotype and the deer karyotypes is more derived compare with those of bovid species. Combining previous cytogenetic and molecular systematic studies, we analyzed the genome phylogeny for 11 cervid species.</p>

Male black muntjacs have an astonishing X1X2Y1Y2Y3 sex chromosome system, unparalleled in eutherian mammals, involving approximately half of the entire genome. A high-resolution comparative map between the black muntjac (M. crinifrons) and the Chinese muntjac (M. reevesi, 2n = 46) has been constructed based on the chromosomal localization of 304 clones from a genomic BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) library of the Indian muntjac (M. muntjak vaginalis, 2n = 6[female symbol]/7[male symbol]). In addition to validating the chromosomal homologies between M. reevesi and M. crinifrons defined previously by chromosome painting, the comparative BAC map demonstrates that all tandem fusions that have occurred in the karyotypic evolution of M. crinifrons are centromere-telomere fusions. The map also allows for a more detailed reconstruction of the chromosomal rearrangements leading to this unique and complex sex chromosome system. Furthermore, we have identified 46 BAC clones that could be used to study the molecular evolution of the unique sex chromosomes of the male black muntjacs.</p>

Of the five muntjac species with defined karyotypes, three species (i.e. Muntiacus reevesi, 2n = 46; M. m. vaginalis, 2n = 6/7; and M. crinifrons, 2n = 8/9) have so far been investigated by a combined approach of comparative chromosome banding, chromosome painting and BAC mapping. The results demonstrated that extensive centromere-telomere fusions and a few centric fusions are the chromosomal mechanisms underlying the karyotypic evolution of muntjacs. Here we have applied the same approach to two additional muntjac species with less well-characterized karyotypes, M. feae (2n = 14 male ) and M. gongshanensis (2n = 8 female). High-resolution G-banded karyotypes for M. feae and M. gongshanensis are provided. The integrated analysis of hybridization results led to the establishment of a high-resolution comparative map between M. reevesi, M. feae, and M. gongshanensis, proving that all tandem fusions underpinning the karyotypic evolution of these two muntjac species are also centromere-telomere fusions. Furthermore, the results have improved our understanding of the karyotypic relationships of extant muntjac species and provided compelling cytogenetic evidence that supports the view that M. crinifrons, M. feae, and M. gongshanensis should each be treated as a distinct species.</p>

The current standard of care for these cancers consists of extended adjuvant treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide after surgical resection and radiotherapy. Although a statistically significant increase in survival has been reported with this regimen, nearly all gliomas recur and become insensitive to further treatment with this class of agents. We sequenced 500 kb of genomic DNA corresponding to the kinase domains of 518 protein kinases in each of nine gliomas. Large numbers of somatic mutations were observed in two gliomas recurrent after alkylating agent treatment. The pattern of mutations in these cases showed strong similarity to that induced by alkylating agents in experimental systems. Further investigation revealed inactivating somatic mutations of the mismatch repair gene MSH6 in each case. We propose that inactivating somatic mutations of MSH6 confer resistance to alkylating agents in gliomas in vivo and concurrently unleash accelerated mutagenesis in resistant clones as a consequence of continued exposure to alkylating agents in the presence of defective mismatch repair. The evidence therefore suggests that when MSH6 is inactivated in gliomas, alkylating agents convert from induction of tumor cell death to promotion of neoplastic progression. These observations highlight the potential of large scale sequencing for revealing and elucidating mutagenic processes operative in individual human cancers.</p>

In order to help identify candidate TSGs, we have constructed a chromosome 6 tile path microarray. The array contains 1,780 clones (778 P1-derived artificial chromosome and 1,002 bacterial artificial chromosome) that cover 98.3% of the published chromosome 6 sequences. A total of 104 adult astrocytic tumours (10 diffuse astrocytomas, 30 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 64 glioblastomas (GB)) were analysed using this array. Single copy number change was successfully detected and the result was in general concordant with a microsatellite analysis. The pattern of copy number change was complex with multiple interstitial deletions/gains. However, a predominance of telomeric 6q deletions was seen. Two small common and overlapping regions of deletion at 6q26 were identified. One was 1,002 kb in size and contained PACRG and QKI, while the second was 199 kb and harbours a single gene, ARID1B. The data show that the chromosome 6 tile path array is useful in mapping copy number changes with high resolution and accuracy. We confirmed the high frequency of chromosome 6 deletions in AA and GB, and identified two novel commonly deleted regions that may harbour TSGs.</p>

The NCI-60 has been characterized pharmacologically and at the molecular level more extensively than any other set of cell lines. However, no systematic mutation analysis of genes causally implicated in oncogenesis has been reported. This study reports the sequence analysis of 24 known cancer genes in the NCI-60 and an assessment of 4 of the 24 genes for homozygous deletions. One hundred thirty-seven oncogenic mutations were identified in 14 (APC, BRAF, CDKN2, CTNNB1, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, SMAD4, PIK3CA, PTEN, RB1, STK11, TP53, and VHL) of the 24 genes. All lines have at least one mutation among the cancer genes examined, with most lines (73%) having more than one. Identification of those cancer genes mutated in the NCI-60, in combination with pharmacologic and molecular profiles of the cells, will allow for more informed interpretation of anticancer agent screening and will enhance the use of the NCI-60 cell lines for molecularly targeted screens.</p>

The genome sequence of the protozoan parasite Leishmania major contains three distinct beta-tubulin loci. To investigate the diversity of beta-tubulin genes, we have compared the published genome sequence to draft genome sequences of two further species L. infantum and L. braziliensis. Untranscribed regions and coding sequences for each isoform were compared within and between species in relation to the known diversity of beta-tubulin transcripts in Leishmania spp.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: All three beta-tubulin loci were present in L. infantum and L. braziliensis, showing conserved synteny with the L. major sequence, hence confirming that these loci are paralogous. Flanking regions suggested that the chromosome 21 locus is an amastigote-specific isoform and more closely related (either structurally or functionally) to the chromosome 33 &#39;array&#39; locus than the chromosome 8 locus. A phylogenetic network of all isoforms indicated that paralogs from L. braziliensis and L. mexicana were monophyletic, rather than clustering by locus.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: L. braziliensis and L. mexicana sequences appeared more similar to each other than each did to its closest relative in another species; this indicates that these sequences have evolved convergently in each species, perhaps through ectopic gene conversion; a process not yet evident among the more recently derived L. major and L. infantum isoforms. The distinctive non-coding regions of each beta-tubulin locus showed that it is the regulatory regions of these loci that have evolved most during the diversification of these genes in Leishmania, while the coding regions have been conserved and concerted. The various loci in Leishmania satisfy a need for innovative expression of beta-tubulin, rather than elaboration of its structural role.</p>

While overall tubulin expression is carefully controlled, most eukaryotes express multiple tubulin genes in specific regulatory or developmental contexts. The genomes of the human parasites Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major reveal that these unicellular kinetoplastids possess arrays of tandem-duplicated tubulin genes, but with differences in organisation. While L. major possesses monotypic alpha and beta arrays in trans, an array of alternating alpha- and beta tubulin genes occurs in T. brucei. Polycistronic transcription in these organisms makes the chromosomal arrangement of tubulin genes important with respect to gene expression.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: We investigated the genomic architecture of tubulin tandem arrays among these parasites, establishing which character state is derived, and the timing of character transition. Tubulin loci in T. brucei and L. major were compared to examine the relationship between the two character states. Intergenic regions between tubulin genes were sequenced from several trypanosomatids and related, non-parasitic bodonids to identify the ancestral state. Evidence of alternating arrays was found among non-parasitic kinetoplastids and all Trypanosoma spp.; monotypic arrays were confirmed in all Leishmania spp. and close relatives.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Alternating and monotypic tubulin arrays were found to be mutually exclusive through comparison of genome sequences. The presence of alternating gene arrays in non-parasitic kinetoplastids confirmed that separate, monotypic arrays are the derived state and evolved through genomic restructuring in the lineage leading to Leishmania. This fundamental reorganisation accounted for the dissimilar genomic architectures of T. brucei and L. major tubulin repertoires.</p>

They are characterised by a symptomatic triad associated with qualitative changes in social interactions, defect in communication abilities, and repetitive and stereotyped interests and activities. ASD is prevalent in 1 to 3 per 1000 people. Despite several arguments for a strong genetic contribution, the molecular basis of a most cases remains unexplained. About 5% of patients with autism have a chromosome abnormality visible with cytogenetic methods. The most frequent are 15q11-q13 duplication, 2q37 and 22q13.3 deletions. Many other chromosomal imbalances have been described. However, most of them remain undetectable using routine karyotype analysis, thus impeding diagnosis and genetic counselling.</p><p class="abstract">29 patients presenting with syndromic ASD were investigated using a DNA microarray constructed from large insert clones spaced at approximately 1 Mb intervals across the genome. Eight clinically relevant rearrangements were identified in 8 (27.5%) patients: six deletions and two duplications. Altered segments ranged in size from 1.4 to 16 Mb (2-19 clones). No recurrent abnormality was identified.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results clearly show that array comparative genomic hybridisation should be considered to be an essential aspect of the genetic analysis of patients with syndromic ASD. Moreover, besides their importance for diagnosis and genetic counselling, they may allow the delineation of new contiguous gene syndromes associated with ASD. Finally, the detailed molecular analysis of the rearranged regions may pave the way for the identification of new ASD genes.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.</p><p class="abstract">Pheochromocytoma is a predominantly sporadic neuroendocrine tumor derived from the adrenal medulla. Previous low resolution LOH and metaphase-CGH studies reported the loss of chromosomes 1p, 3q, 17p and 22q at various frequencies. However, the molecular mechanism(s) behind development of sporadic pheochromocytoma remains largely unknown. We have applied high-resolution tiling-path microarray-CGH with the primary aim to characterize copy number imbalances affecting chromosome 22 in 66 sporadic pheochromocytomas. We detected copy number alterations on 22q at a frequency of 44%. The predominant finding was monosomy 22 (30%), followed by terminal deletions in 8 samples (12%) and a single interstitial deletion. We further applied a chromosome 1 tiling-path array in 7 tumors with terminal deletions of 22q and found deletions of 1p in all cases. Our overall results suggest that at least 2 distinct regions on both 22q and 1p are important in the tumorigenesis of sporadic pheochromocytoma. A large proportion of pheochromocytomas also displayed indications of cellular heterogeneity. Our study is to our knowledge the first array-CGH study of sporadic pheochromocytoma. Future analysis of this tumor type should preferably be performed in the context of the entire human genome using genome-wide array-CGH, which is a superior methodological approach.

A favored and partial explanation for this range of intron densities has been that introns have accumulated stochastically in large eukaryote genomes during their evolution from an intron-poor ancestor. However, recent studies have shown that some eukaryotes lost many introns, whereas others accumulated and/or gained many introns. In this article, we discuss the growing evidence that these differences are subject to selection acting on introns depending on the biology of the organism and the gene involved.</p>

Combined sequence comparison of HVS-I and HVS-II led to the identification of 167 different haplotypes characterized by 154 variable sites. One hundred and fifty-one of the haplotypes were individual-specific, 14 were found in two individuals and 2 were found in three individuals. A pairwise comparison of the 185 HVS-I/II sequences found an average of 10.11 +/- 4.63 differences between individuals. The random match probability and gene diversity for the combined hypervariable regions were estimated at 0.66% and 0.9988, respectively. Analyzing the expanded database including three previously reported data sets and the present data using haplogroup-based comparisons and comparison with closely related sequences allowed errors to be detected and eliminated, thus considerably improving data quality. Sample division comparisons based on PhiST genetic distance measures revealed no significant population differentiation in the distribution of mtDNA sequence variations between the present data set and a database in The Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM), but did indicate differences from other sets of data. Based on the results of mtDNA profiles, almost all of the mtDNA types studied here could be classified into subsets of haplogroups common in east Asia, and show that the Koreans possess lineages from both the southern and the northern haplogroup complexes of east Asian populations. The new data, combined with other mtDNA sequences, demonstrate how useful comparison with closely related mtDNA sequences can be for improving database quality, as well as providing haplotype information for forensic and population genetic analyses in the Korean population.</p>

By employing an ontological analysis we show that REST target genes are significantly enriched in a number of functional classes. Taking the novel REST target gene CACNA1A as an experimental model, we show that it can be regulated by multiple RE1s of different binding affinities, which are only partially conserved between human and mouse. A novel BLAST methodology indicated that many RE1s belong to closely related families. Most of these sequences are associated with transposable elements, leading us to propose that transposon-mediated duplication and insertion of RE1s has led to the acquisition of novel target genes by REST during evolution.</p>

The aim of this study was to assess the level of conservation of PiaA and PiuA and a third iron uptake ABC transporter lipoprotein, PitA, between common S. pneumoniae capsular serotypes by sequencing the corresponding genes, and to investigate whether these antigens can protect against respiratory infection. The nucleotide sequences of piuA and piaA were highly conserved in all strains, whereas pitA had significant variation in its nucleotide sequence making PitA an unattractive vaccine candidate. Mucosal vaccination of mice with PiuA and PiaA elicited specific antibody responses in serum and respiratory secretions, and protected against intranasal challenge with S. pneumoniae. These results provide further data indicating that PiuA and PiaA would be suitable candidates for a S. pneumoniae protein antigen vaccine.</p>

Mimetic insects are known for their diversity of patterns as well as their remarkable evolutionary convergence, and they have played an important role in controversies over the respective roles of selection and constraints in adaptive evolution. Here we contrast three butterfly species, all classic examples of M&uuml;llerian mimicry. We used a genetic linkage map to show that a locus, Yb, which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of Heliconius melpomene, maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr, which has very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore, the same genomic location acts as a &quot;supergene&quot;, determining multiple sympatric morphs in a third species, H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic appearance, whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the genus Melinaea. Other unlinked colour pattern loci map to a homologous linkage group in the co-mimics H. melpomene and H. erato, but they are not involved in mimetic polymorphism in H. numata. Hence, a single region from the multilocus colour pattern architecture of H. melpomene and H. erato appears to have gained control of the entire wing-pattern variability in H. numata, presumably as a result of selection for mimetic &quot;supergene&quot; polymorphism without intermediates. Although we cannot at this stage confirm the homology of the loci segregating in the three species, our results imply that a conserved yet relatively unconstrained mechanism underlying pattern switching can affect mimicry in radically different ways. We also show that adaptive evolution, both convergent and diversifying, can occur by the repeated involvement of the same genomic regions.</p>

This study investigated the alterations in the DNA copy number and the expression profiles of the genes located in the altered regions in mouse thymic lymphomas that were induced by two mutagens, gamma-irradiation and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization was used to precisely delineate the boundaries of the altered region. The copy number gains of chromosomes 4 and 5 were observed only in the radiation-induced lymphomas, and gains of chromosomes 10 and 14 were observed only in the MNU-induced lymphomas. Regional copy number losses in chromosomes 11, 16, and 19 appeared frequently in the radiation-induced lymphomas. The cancer-related genes Pten, Ikaros/Znfn1a1, Ercc4, and Top3b were located in the minimal deletion regions. In particular, the expression levels of the Pten, Top3b, and Ikaros genes were downregulated in both lymphoma groups, but the expression level of Ercc4 was downregulated only in the MNU group. This study also examined the expression levels of Sparc, Cxcl1, and Myc (synonym: c-Myc), which are located in the copy number gained chromosomes. Sparc was upregulated specifically in the radiation group, and Cxcl1 in the MNU group. c-Myc was upregulated in both groups. There was limited correlation between the DNA copy number profiles and the expression of the cancer-related genes in mouse lymphomagenesis. The chromosome aberrations and novel expression profiles of the cancer-related genes within the altered regions may provide important clues to the genetic mechanism for the development of lymphoma.</p>

However, such mutants replicate normally in Trichoplusia ni (TN-368) cells. An AcMNPV plaque isolate (AcdefrT) was identified during propagation of a virus deficient in p35 in TN-368 cells. This virus exhibited enhanced budded-particle formation in TN-368 cells, but was partially defective for polyhedra production in the same cells. Virus replication in AcdefrT-infected TN-368 cells was accompanied by extensive plasma-membrane blebbing and caspase activation late in infection, both features of apoptosis. Rescue of the p35 locus of AcdefrT continued to result in a reduction in polyhedra and increase in budded virus production in TN-368 cells, but no plasma-membrane blebbing was observed. The mutation was mapped to the FP-25 gene locus. This gene mutation combined with the non-functional p35 was found to be responsible for the cell-blebbing effect observed in AcdefrT-infected TN-368 cells.</p>

However, the majority of data from human tumors have not supported a similar role for p63 in tumor suppression. To investigate this issue, we studied spontaneous tumorigenesis in p63+/- mice in both WT and p53-compromised backgrounds. We found that p63+/- mice were not tumor prone and mice heterozygous for both p63 and p53 had fewer tumors than p53+/- mice. The rare tumors that developed in mice with compromised p63 were also distinct from those of p53+/- mice. Furthermore, p63+/- mice were not prone to chemically induced tumorigenesis, and p63 expression was maintained in carcinomas. These findings demonstrate that, in agreement with data from human tumors, p63 plays a markedly different biological role in cancer than p53.</p>

Alignment of DNA sequence from different sources has been used to identify SNPs and intermediate-sized variants (ISVs). However, only a small proportion of total heterogeneity is characterized, and little is known of the characteristics of most smaller-sized (&lt;50 kb) variants. Here we show that genome assembly comparison is a robust approach for identification of all classes of genetic variation. Through comparison of two human assemblies (Celera&#39;s R27c compilation and the Build 35 reference sequence), we identified megabases of sequence (in the form of 13,534 putative non-SNP events) that were absent, inverted or polymorphic in one assembly. Database comparison and laboratory experimentation further demonstrated overlap or validation for 240 variable regions and confirmed &gt;1.5 million SNPs. Some differences were simple insertions and deletions, but in regions containing CNVs, segmental duplication and repetitive DNA, they were more complex. Our results uncover substantial undescribed variation in humans, highlighting the need for comprehensive annotation strategies to fully interpret genome scanning and personalized sequencing projects.</p>

Despite the existence of a sexual phase in the life cycle, T. gondii has an unusual population structure dominated by three clonal lineages that predominate in North America and Europe, (Types I, II, and III). These lineages were founded by common ancestors approximately10,000 yr ago. The recent origin and widespread distribution of the clonal lineages is attributed to the circumvention of the sexual cycle by a new mode of transmission-asexual transmission between intermediate hosts. Asexual transmission appears to be multigenic and although the specific genes mediating this trait are unknown, it is predicted that all members of the clonal lineages should share the same alleles. Genetic mapping studies suggested that chromosome Ia was unusually monomorphic compared with the rest of the genome. To investigate this further, we sequenced chromosome Ia and chromosome Ib in the Type I strain, RH, and the Type II strain, ME49. Comparative genome analyses of the two chromosomal sequences revealed that the same copy of chromosome Ia was inherited in each lineage, whereas chromosome Ib maintained the same high frequency of between-strain polymorphism as the rest of the genome. Sampling of chromosome Ia sequence in seven additional representative strains from the three clonal lineages supports a monomorphic inheritance, which is unique within the genome. Taken together, our observations implicate a specific combination of alleles on chromosome Ia in the recent origin and widespread success of the clonal lineages of T. gondii.</p>

In addition, the contribution of CNVs to human disease susceptibility may be greater than previously expected, although a complete understanding of the phenotypic consequences of CNVs is incomplete. We have recently reported a comprehensive view of CNVs among 270 HapMap samples using high-density SNP genotyping arrays and BAC array CGH. In this report, we describe a novel algorithm using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Early Access (500K EA) arrays that identified 1203 CNVs ranging in size from 960 bp to 3.4 Mb. The algorithm consists of three steps: (1) Intensity pre-processing to improve the resolution between pairwise comparisons by directly estimating the allele-specific affinity as well as to reduce signal noise by incorporating probe and target sequence characteristics via an improved version of the Genomic Imbalance Map (GIM) algorithm; (2) CNV extraction using an adapted SW-ARRAY procedure to automatically and robustly detect candidate CNV regions; and (3) copy number inference in which all pairwise comparisons are summarized to more precisely define CNV boundaries and accurately estimate CNV copy number. Independent testing of a subset of CNVs by quantitative PCR and mass spectrometry demonstrated a &gt;90% verification rate. The use of high-resolution oligonucleotide arrays relative to other methods may allow more precise boundary information to be extracted, thereby enabling a more accurate analysis of the relationship between CNVs and other genomic features.</p>

To overcome this limitation, we used three-dimensional (3D) MEAs with tip-shaped electrodes to probe plasticity of field excitatory synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the CA1 area of hippocampal slices of 129S5/SvEvBrd and C57BL/6J-TyrC-Brd mice.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: Using 3D MEAs, we were able to record larger fEPSPs compared to signals measured by planar MEAs. Several stimulation protocols were used to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic responses in the CA1 area recorded following excitation of Sch&auml;ffer collateral/commissural fibres. Either two trains of high frequency tetanic stimulation or three trains of theta-burst stimulation caused a persistent, pathway specific enhancement of fEPSPs that remained significantly elevated for at least 60 min. A third LTP induction protocol that comprised 150 pulses delivered at 5 Hz, evoked moderate LTP if excitation strength was increased to 1.5x of the baseline stimulus. In all cases, we observed a clear spatial plasticity gradient with maximum LTP levels detected in proximal apical dendrites of pyramidal neurones. No significant differences in the manifestation of LTP were observed between 129S5/SvEvBrd and C57BL/6J-TyrC-Brd mice with the three protocols used. All forms of plasticity were sensitive to inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Principal features of LTP (magnitude, pathway specificity, NMDA receptor dependence) recorded in the hippocampal slices using MEAs were very similar to those seen in conventional glass electrode experiments. Advantages of using MEAs are the ability to record from different regions of the slice and the ease of conducting several experiments on a multiplexed platform which could be useful for efficient screening of novel transgenic mice.</p>

This can lead to genomic imbalances associated with several known genetic disorders. We report here a developmentally delayed patient carrying different rearrangements on both chromosome 22 homologues, including a previously unreported rearrangement within the 22q11 region. One homologue carries a deletion of the proximal part of chromosome band 22q11. To our knowledge, a &#39;pure&#39; deletion of this region has not been described previously. Four copies of this 22q11 region, however, are associated with Cat eye syndrome (CES). While the phenotypic impact of this deletion is unclear, familial investigation revealed five normal relatives carrying this deletion, suggesting that haplo-insufficiency of the CES region has little clinical relevance. The other chromosome 22 homologue carries a duplication of the Velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS) region. In addition, a previously undescribed deletion of 22q12.1, located in a relatively gene-poor region, was identified. As the clinical features of patients suffering from a duplication of the VCFS/DGS region have proven to be extremely variable, it is impossible to postulate as to the contribution of the 22q12.1 deletion to the phenotype of the patient. Additional patients with a deletion within this region are needed to establish the consequences of this copy number alteration. This study highlights the value of using different genomic approaches to unravel chromosomal alterations in order to study their phenotypic impact.</p>

Receptors of the mammalian innate immune system play an essential role in the detection of infected or transformed cells and are vital for the initiation and regulation of a full adaptive immune response. The genes for several of these receptors are clustered within the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The purpose of this study was to carry out a detailed analysis of the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) LRC. Bacterial artificial chromosomes containing genes related to mammalian leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors were identified in a chicken genomic library and shown to map to a single microchromosome. Sequencing revealed 103 chicken immunoglobulin-like receptor (CHIR) loci (22 inhibitory, 25 activating, 15 bifunctional, and 41 pseudogenes). A very complex splicing pattern was found using transcript analyses and seven hypervariable regions were detected in the external CHIR domains. Phylogenetic and genomic analysis showed that CHIR genes evolved mainly by block duplications from an ancestral inhibitory receptor locus, with transformation into activating receptors occurring more than once. Evolutionary selection pressure has led not only to an exceptional expansion of the CHIR cluster but also to a dramatic diversification of CHIR loci and haplotypes. This indicates that CHIRs have the potential to complement the adaptive immune system in fighting pathogens.</p>

The effectiveness of RNAi varies from gene to gene, however, and neuronally expressed genes are largely refractive to RNAi in wild-type worms.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: We found that C. elegans strains carrying mutations in lin-35, the worm ortholog of the tumor suppressor gene p105Rb, or a subset of the genetically related synMuv B family of chromatin-modifying genes, show increased strength and penetrance for many germline, embryonic, and post-embryonic RNAi phenotypes, including neuronal RNAi phenotypes. Mutations in these same genes also enhance somatic transgene silencing via an RNAi-dependent mechanism. Two genes, mes-4 and zfp-1, are required both for the vulval lineage defects resulting from mutations in synMuv B genes and for RNAi, suggesting a common mechanism for the function of synMuv B genes in vulval development and in regulating RNAi. Enhanced RNAi in the germline of lin-35 worms suggests that misexpression of germline genes in somatic cells cannot alone account for the enhanced RNAi observed in this strain.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A worm strain with a null mutation in lin-35 is more sensitive to RNAi than any other previously described single mutant strain, and so will prove very useful for future genome-wide RNAi screens, particularly for identifying genes with neuronal functions. As lin-35 is the worm ortholog of the mammalian tumor suppressor gene p105Rb, misregulation of RNAi may be important during human oncogenesis.</p>

<p class="affiliation">The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1HH, UK.</p><p class="abstract">Most heritable traits, including disease susceptibility, are affected by interactions between multiple genes. However, we understand little about how genes interact because very few possible genetic interactions have been explored experimentally. We have used RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans to systematically test approximately 65,000 pairs of genes for their ability to interact genetically. We identify approximately 350 genetic interactions between genes functioning in signaling pathways that are mutated in human diseases, including components of the EGF/Ras, Notch and Wnt pathways. Most notably, we identify a class of highly connected &#39;hub&#39; genes: inactivation of these genes can enhance the phenotypic consequences of mutation of many different genes. These hub genes all encode chromatin regulators, and their activity as genetic hubs seems to be conserved across animals. We propose that these genes function as general buffers of genetic variation and that these hub genes may act as modifier genes in multiple, mechanistically unrelated genetic diseases in humans.</p>

Genetic variation in P-glycoprotein, the product of the ABCB1 gene, is proposed to mediate de novo drug resistance, but associations between polymorphisms in ABCB1 and pharmacoresistance have produced conflicting results.

Sequencing of exons in 47 Caucasian individuals identified 75 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously undescribed in any public database, including 14 new coding sequence SNPs.

Chromosome-specific painting probes were generated from flow-sorted chromosomes of E. proditor and hybridized onto metaphases of E. proditor, E. miletus and M. clarkei, leading to the establishment of genome-wide comparative chromosome maps. Our results demonstrate that Robertsonian translocations (centric fusions) have played a major role in the karyotype evolution of oriental voles with no obvious evidence for the involvement of tandem fusions as proposed previously and that the genome organizations of vole species are highly conserved. The comparative chromosome maps of these three vole species belonging to two phylogenetically distinct genera provide a framework for future studies on the karyotype evolution in voles.</p>

Several recent papers of comparative painting between tree and flying squirrels have shed some light on the evolution of the family Sciuridae and the order Rodentia. In the present study we have extended the comparative painting to the Himalayan marmot (Marmotahimalayana) and the African ground squirrel (Xerus cf. erythropus), i.e. representative species from another important squirrel group--the ground squirrels--, and have established genome-wide comparative chromosome maps between human, eastern gray squirrel, and these two ground squirrels. The results show that 1) the squirrels so far studied all have conserved karyotypes that resemble the ancestral karyotype of the order Rodentia; 2) the African ground squirrels could have retained the ancestral karyotype of the family Sciuridae. Furthermore, we have mapped the evolutionary rearrangements onto a molecular-based consensus phylogenetic tree of the family Sciuridae.</p>

Moreover, our understanding of sequence variation within the duplicated sequences that are substrates for NAHR lags far behind that of sequence variation within the single-copy portion of the genome. Perhaps the best-characterized NAHR hotspot lies within the 24-kb-long Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)-repeats (REPs) that sponsor deletions and duplications that cause peripheral neuropathies. We investigated structural and sequence diversity within the CMT1A-REPs, both within and between species. We discovered a high frequency of retroelement insertions, accelerated sequence evolution after duplication, extensive paralogous gene conversion, and a greater than twofold enrichment of SNPs in humans relative to the genome average. We identified an allelic recombination hotspot underlying the known NAHR hotspot, which suggests that the two processes are intimately related. Finally, we used our data to develop a novel method for inferring the location of an NAHR hotspot from sequence variation within segmental duplications and applied it to identify a putative NAHR hotspot within the LCR22 repeats that sponsor velocardiofacial syndrome deletions. We propose that a large-scale project to map sequence variation within segmental duplications would reveal a wealth of novel chromosomal-rearrangement hotspots.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Ume&aring; Plant Science Centre, Department of Plant Physiology, Ume&aring; University, S-901 87 Ume&aring;, Sweden.</p><p class="abstract">We investigated the role of metabolite transporters in cold acclimation by comparing the responses of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis thaliana (Heynh.) with that of transgenic plants over-expressing sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPSox) or with that of antisense repression of cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPas). Plants were grown at 23 degrees C and then shifted to 5 degrees C. We compared the leaves shifted to 5 degrees C for 3 and 10 d with new leaves that developed at 5 degrees C with control leaves on plants at 23 degrees C. At 23 degrees C, ectopic expression of SPS resulted in 30% more carbon being fixed per day and an increase in sucrose export from source leaves. This increase in fixation and export was supported by increased expression of the plastidic triose-phosphate transporter AtTPT and, to a lesser extent, the high-affinity Suc transporter AtSUC1. The improved photosynthetic performance of the SPSox plants was maintained after they were shifted to 5 degrees C and this was associated with further increases in AtSUC1 expression but with a strong repression of AtTPT mRNA abundance. Similar responses were shown by WT plants during acclimation to low temperature and this response was attenuated in the low sucrose producing FBPas plants. These data suggest that a key element in recovering flux through carbohydrate metabolism in the cold is to control the partitioning of metabolites between the chloroplast and the cytosol, and Arabidopsis modulates the expression of AtTPT to maintain balanced carbon flow. Arabidopsis also up-regulates the expression of AtSUC1, and to lesser extent AtSUC2, as down-stream components facilitate sucrose transport in leaves that develop at low temperatures.</p>

Because the second messenger cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate can regulate the activity of different forms of the cyclic AMP degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase, we examined whether increases in cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate can modulate long-term potentiation induction in the mouse hippocampal CA1 region through effects on cyclic AMP signaling. Using the cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast or the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-D,L-penicillamine to elevate cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate levels we found that increases in cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate strongly inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation by low-frequency patterns of synaptic stimulation where protein kinase A activation is required for long-term potentiation induction. In contrast, zaprinast and S-nitroso-D,L-penicillamine had no effect on the induction of long-term potentiation by high-frequency patterns of synaptic stimulation that induce long-term potentiation in a protein kinase A-independent manner. Directly activating protein kinase A with the phosphodiesterase-resistant cyclic AMP analog 8-Br-cAMP, blocking all phosphodiesterases with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, or inhibiting protein phosphatases rescued long-term potentiation induction in zaprinast-treated slices. Together, these results suggest that increases in cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate inhibit long-term potentiation by activating phosphodiesterases that interfere with the protein kinase A-mediated suppression of protein phosphatases needed for long-term potentiation induction. Consistent with the notion that this cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate-mediated inhibitory pathway is recruited by some patterns of synaptic activity, blocking cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate production strongly facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation by long trains of theta-frequency synaptic stimulation. Together, our results indicate that increases in cyclic guanosine 3&#39;,5&#39;monophosphate can act as a long-term potentiation suppressor mechanism that selectively constrains the induction of protein kinase A-dependent forms of long-term potentiation induced by low-frequency patterns of synaptic stimulation.</p>

<p class="affiliation">School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9QG, UK.</p><p class="abstract">The deafness (dn) and Beethoven (Bth) mutant mice are models for profound congenital deafness (DFNB7/B11) and progressive hearing loss (DFNA36), respectively, caused by recessive and dominant mutations of transmembrane cochlear-expressed gene 1 (TMC1), which encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown function. In the mouse cochlea Tmc1 is expressed in both outer (OHCs) and inner (IHCs) hair cells from early stages of development. Immature hair cells of mutant mice seem normal in appearance and biophysical properties. From around P8 for OHCs and P12 for IHCs, mutants fail to acquire (dn/dn) or show reduced expression (Bth/Bth and, to a lesser extent Bth/+) of the K+ currents which contribute to their normal functional maturation (the BK-type current IK,f in IHCs, and the delayed rectifier IK,n in both cell types). Moreover, the exocytotic machinery in mutant IHCs does not develop normally as judged by the persistence of immature features of the Ca2+ current and exocytosis into adulthood. Mutant mice exhibited progressive hair cell damage and loss. The compound action potential (CAP) thresholds of Bth/+ mice were raised and correlated with the degree of hair cell loss. Homozygous mutants (dn/dn and Bth/Bth) never showed CAP responses, even at ages where many hair cells were still present in the apex of the cochlea, suggesting their hair cells never function normally. We propose that Tmc1 is involved in trafficking of molecules to the plasma membrane or serves as an intracellular regulatory signal for differentiation of immature hair cells into fully functional auditory receptors.</p>

While these microarray papers largely agree on the main patterns of cell cycle-regulated transcription and its control, there are discrepancies with regard to the identity and numbers of periodically expressed genes. We present benchmark and reproducibility analyses showing that the main discrepancies do not reflect differences in the data themselves (microarray or synchronization methods seem to lead only to minor biases) but rather in the interpretation of the data. Our reanalysis of the three datasets reveals that combining all independent information leads to an improved identification of periodically expressed genes. These evaluations suggest that the available microarray data do not allow reliable identification of more than about 500 cell cycle-regulated genes. The temporal expression pattern of the top 500 periodically expressed genes is generally consistent across experiments and the three studies, together with our integrated analysis, provide a coherent and rich source of information on cell cycle-regulated gene expression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The reanalysed datasets and other supplementary information are available from an accompanying website: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cellcycle/. We hope that this paper will resolve the apparent discrepancies between the previous studies and be useful both for wet-lab biologists and for theoretical scientists who wish to take advantage of the data for follow-up work.</p>

Recent studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that the RNA-binding protein Csx1 plays a central role in controlling gene expression during oxidative stress. It does so by stabilizing atf1(+) mRNA, which encodes a subunit of a bZIP transcription factor required for gene expression during oxidative stress. Here, we describe two related proteins, Cip1 and Cip2, that were identified by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) as proteins that coprecipitate with Csx1. Cip1 and Cip2 are cytoplasmic proteins that have RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Neither protein is essential for viability, but a cip1Delta cip2Delta strain grows poorly and has altered cellular morphology. Genetic epistasis studies and whole genome expression profiling show that Cip1 and Cip2 exert posttranscriptional control of gene expression in a manner that is counteracted by Csx1. Notably, the sensitivity of csx1Delta cells to oxidative stress and their inability to induce expression of Atf1-dependent genes are partially rescued by cip1Delta and cip2Delta mutations. This study emphasizes the importance of a modulated mRNA stability in the eukaryotic stress response pathways and adds new information to the role of RNA-binding proteins in the oxidative stress response.</p>

Phage display vectors are ideal for efficient display of antibody fragments on the surface of bacteriophage particles. However, they are often inefficient for expression of soluble antibody fragments, and sub-cloning of selected antibody populations into dedicated soluble antibody fragment expression vectors can enhance expression.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: We have developed a simple vector system for expression, dimerisation and detection of recombinant antibody fragments in the form of single chain Fvs (scFvs). Expression is driven by the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in conjunction with the inducible lysogen strain BL21 (DE3). The system is compatible with a simple auto-induction culture system for scFv production. As an alternative to periplasmic expression, expression directly in the cytoplasm of a mutant strain with a more oxidising cytoplasmic environment (Origami 2 (DE3)) was investigated and found to be inferior to periplasmic expression in BL21 (DE3) cells. The effect on yield and binding activity of fusing scFvs to the N terminus of maltose binding protein (a solubility enhancing partner), bacterial alkaline phosphatase (a naturally dimeric enzymatic reporter molecule), or the addition of a free C-terminal cysteine was determined. Fusion of scFvs to the N-terminus of maltose binding protein increased scFv yield but binding activity of the scFv was compromised. In contrast, fusion to the N-terminus of bacterial alkaline phosphatase led to an improved performance. Alkaline phosphatase provides a convenient tag allowing direct enzymatic detection of scFv fusions within crude extracts without the need for secondary reagents. Alkaline phosphatase also drives dimerisation of the scFv leading to an improvement in performance compared to monovalent constructs. This is illustrated by ELISA, western blot and immunohistochemistry.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nine scFv expression vectors have been generated and tested. Three vectors showed utility for expression of functional scFv fragments. One vector, pSANG14-3F, produces scFv-alkaline phosphatase fusion molecules which offers a simple, convenient and sensitive way of determining the reactivity of recombinant antibody fragments in a variety of common assay systems.</p>

<p class="affiliation">D&eacute;partement de Biologie du D&eacute;veloppement, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.</p><p class="abstract">Although recent progress in identifying genes involved in deafness has been remarkable, the genetic basis of progressive hearing loss (or age-related hearing loss) is poorly understood because of the extreme difficulty in studying such a late-onset, complex disease in human populations. Several inbred strains of mice such as 129P1/ReJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and BALB/cByJ have been reported to exhibit age-related hearing loss and provide valuable models for human nonsyndromic progressive deafness. In this article we show that 101/H mice also exhibit progressive deafness with early onset. Linkage analysis of F(2) populations derived from crosses between the 101/H and the MAI/Pas and MBT/Pas wild-derived mice suggested at least two major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence progressive hearing loss. A first QTL, designated Phl1, was mapped with a maximum LOD score of 6.7 to the centromeric region of Chromosome 17, where no deafness-related QTL has been mapped so far. A second QTL, designated Phl2, mapped to Chromosome 10 and exhibited a maximum LOD score of 5.3. The map position of Phl2 near the well-known QTL of age-related hearing loss (Ahl) suggested the possibility of allelism, although the Ahl mutation itself did not segregate in these crosses. Finally, we found some evidence of epistatic interaction between Phl1 and Phl2.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Cancer Research UK Fission Yeast Functional Genomics Group, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge CB10 1HH, United Kingdom.</p><p class="abstract">Fission yeast cells belong to one of two specialized cell types, M or P. Specific environmental conditions trigger sexual differentiation, which leads to an internal program starting with pheromone signaling between M and P cells, followed by mating, meiosis, and sporulation. The initial steps of this process are controlled by Ste11p, a master transcriptional regulator that activates the expression of cell type-specific genes (only expressed in either M or P cells) as well as genes expressed in both M and P cells. Pheromone signaling is activated by Ste11p-dependent transcription and, in turn, enhances some of this transcription in a positive feedback. To obtain a genomewide view of Ste11p target genes, their cell-type specificity, and their dependence on pheromone, we used DNA microarrays along with different genetic and environmental manipulations of fission yeast cells. We identified 78 Ste11p-dependent genes, 12 and 4 of which are only expressed in M and P cells, respectively. These genes show differing grades of pheromone dependencies for Ste11p-activated transcription, ranging from complete independence to complete dependence on pheromone. We systematically deleted all novel cell type-specific genes and characterized their phenotype during sexual differentiation. A comparison with a similar data set from the distantly related budding yeast reveals striking conservation in both number and types of the proteins that define cell types. Given the divergent mechanisms regulating cell type-specific gene expression, our results highlight the plasticity of regulatory circuits, which evolve to allow adaptation to changing environments and lifestyles.</p>

<p class="affiliation">School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary, University of London, London E1 4NS, United Kingdom.</p><p class="abstract">Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. Although most of these elements share little sequence identity to each other, a small number are remarkably similar and appear to be the product of duplication events. Here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in the human genome, using comparisons with Fugu to select putative cis-regulatory sequences. We identified 124 families of duplicated elements, each containing between two and five members, that are highly conserved within and between vertebrate genomes. In 74% of cases, we were able to assign a specific set of paralogous genes with annotation relating to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family, thus removing much of the ambiguity in identifying associated genes. We find that duplicate elements have the potential to up-regulate reporter gene expression in a tissue-specific manner and that expression domains often overlap, but are not necessarily identical, between family members. Over two thirds of the families are conserved in duplicate in fish and appear to predate the large-scale duplication events thought to have occurred at the origin of vertebrates. We propose a model whereby gene duplication and the evolution of cis-regulatory elements can be considered in the context of increased morphological diversity and the emergence of the modern vertebrate body plan.</p>

We mapped the cord1 locus to a region of canine chromosome CFA15 that is syntenic with a region of human chromosome 14 (HSA14q11.2) containing the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1) gene. Mutations in RPGRIP1 have been shown to cause Leber congenital amaurosis, a group of retinal dystrophies that represent the most common genetic causes of congenital visual impairment in infants and children. Using the newly available canine genome sequence we sequenced RPGRIP1 in affected and carrier MLHDs and identified a 44-nucleotide insertion in exon 2 that alters the reading frame and introduces a premature stop codon. All affected and carrier dogs within an extended inbred pedigree were homozygous and heterozygous, respectively, for the mutation. We conclude the mutation is responsible for cord1 and demonstrate that this canine disease is a valuable model for exploring disease mechanisms and potential therapies for human Leber congenital amaurosis.</p>

The molecular and cellular basis of these processes is actively studied in model organs such as mammary glands, liver and kidney, but they remain almost unexplored in the male reproductive tract. Here, we report that the orphan G protein-coupled receptor LGR4/GPR48 plays a role in the postnatal tissue remodeling needed for elongation and convolution of the efferent ducts and epididymis. In LGR4 knockout male mice, tube elongation fails, resulting in a hypoplastic and poorly convoluted tract. Cell proliferation is dramatically reduced in KO affected tissues, providing an explanation to the observed phenotype. Detailed analysis showed that LGR4 inactivation manifests differently in the affected organs. In efferent ducts, immune cells infiltrate the epithelium and reach the lumen, blocking the transit of sperm and testicular fluid. In addition, the hypoplasia and low convolution result in a reduction of the epithelial area involved in liquid reabsorption. Both phenomena contribute in tissue swelling upstream the blockade due to liquid and sperm accumulation, with secondary damaging effects on the germinal epithelium. In the epididymis, the thin and highly convoluted duct is replaced by a large cystic tube which is surrounded by a thick condensation of mesenchymal cells. The abnormal organization of the cellular compartments in and around the ducts suggests that LGR4 might play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Altogether, our data identify LGR4 as an important signaling molecule implicated in the tube morphogenesis of the male reproductive tract.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, United Kingdom.</p><p class="abstract">Large-scale association studies are being undertaken with the hope of uncovering the genetic determinants of complex disease. We describe a computationally efficient method for inferring genealogies from population genotype data and show how these genealogies can be used to fine map disease loci and interpret association signals. These genealogies take the form of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). The ARG defines a genealogical tree for each locus, and, as one moves along the chromosome, the topologies of consecutive trees shift according to the impact of historical recombination events. There are two stages to our analysis. First, we infer plausible ARGs, using a heuristic algorithm, which can handle unphased and missing data and is fast enough to be applied to large-scale studies. Second, we test the genealogical tree at each locus for a clustering of the disease cases beneath a branch, suggesting that a causative mutation occurred on that branch. Since the true ARG is unknown, we average this analysis over an ensemble of inferred ARGs. We have characterized the performance of our method across a wide range of simulated disease models. Compared with simpler tests, our method gives increased accuracy in positioning untyped causative loci and can also be used to estimate the frequencies of untyped causative alleles. We have applied our method to Ueda et al.&#39;s association study of CTLA4 and Graves disease, showing how it can be used to dissect the association signal, giving potentially interesting results of allelic heterogeneity and interaction. Similar approaches analyzing an ensemble of ARGs inferred using our method may be applicable to many other problems of inference from population genotype data.</p>

We obtained mammograms from 206 female carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 96 of whom were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer and 136 relatives of carriers who were themselves noncarriers. We compared the mammographic densities of affected carriers (cases) and unaffected carriers (controls), and of mutation carriers and noncarriers, using a computer-assisted method of measurement and visual assessment by two observers. Analyses were adjusted for age, parity, body mass index, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy use. There was no difference in the mean percent density between noncarriers and carriers. Among carriers, increasing mammographic density was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (P(trend) = 0.024). The odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval) for breast cancer associated with a density of &gt; or =50% was 2.29 (1.23-4.26; P = 0.009). The OR did not differ between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers or between premenopausal and postmenopausal carriers. The results suggest that the distribution of breast density in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers is similar to that in non-carriers. High breast density in carriers is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, with the relative risk being similar to that observed in the general population.

In this study we screened 8.5 kb of Y chromosomal DNA for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel of 95 male individuals belonging to different haplogroups. Five novel Y-SNPs (PK1-5) were identified, four in the Pakistani sample and one in an African sample. The ancestral state of each SNP was determined in two chimpanzee samples and a variety of Pakistani ethnic groups. In addition to these novel Y-SNPs 77 additional markers on the Y chromosome were analyzed to place the SNPs on the phylogenetic tree of Y chromosomal lineages and to further investigate extant human Y chromosomal variation within Pakistan. BATWING analysis gave an estimate of between 2,500 and 7,300 YBP for population expansion in Pakistan which coincides with the period of the Indus Valley civilizations.</p>

Patients with these tumors have limited treatment options and their disease is invariably fatal. Molecularly targeted agents offer the potential to improve patient treatment, however the use of these will require a fuller understanding of the genetic changes in these complex tumors. In this study, we identify copy number changes in a series of glioblastoma multiforme tumors and cell lines by applying high-resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization. Molecular cytogenetic characterization of the cell lines revealed that copy number changes define translocation breakpoints. We focused on chromosome 6 and further characterized three regions of copy number change associated with translocations including a discrete deletion involving IGF2R, PARK2, PACRG and QKI and an unbalanced translocation involving POLH, GTPBP2 and PTPRZ1.</p>

We have carried out microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation on a series of 76 Wilms tumour samples, enriched for cases which recurred, to identify changes in DNA copy number associated with clinical outcome. Using 1Mb-spaced genome-wide BAC arrays, the most significantly different genomic changes between favourable histology tumours that did (n = 37), and did not (n = 39), subsequently relapse were gains on 1q, and novel deletions at 12q24 and 18q21. Further relapse-associated loci included losses at 1q32.1, 2q36.3-2q37.1, and gain at 13q31. 1q gains correlated strongly with loss of 1p and/or 16q. In 3 of 11 cases with concurrent 1p(-)/1q(+), a breakpoint was identified at 1p13. Multiple low-level sub-megabase gains along the length of 1q were identified using chromosome 1 tiling-path arrays. One such recurrent region at 1q22-q23.1 included candidate genes RAB25, NES, CRABP2, HDGF and NTRK1, which were screened for mRNA expression using quantitative RT-PCR. These data provide a high-resolution catalogue of genomic copy number changes in relapsing favourable histology Wilms tumours.</p>

The V600E BRAF mutation accounts for approximately 90% of the mutations identified. A strong case has emerged from molecular, cellular, and structural studies for the identification and development of inhibitors of this mutated BRAF protein. The authors have developed and run a high-throughput screen to find inhibitors of V600E BRAF using an enzyme cascade assay in which oncogenic BRAF activates MEK1, which in turn activates ERK2, which then phosphorylates the transcription factor ELK1. A phosphospecific antibody, Europium-labeled secondary antibody, and a time-resolved fluorescent readout were used to measure phosphorylation of ELK1. Overall assay variation was 12.4%. The assay was used to screen 64,000 compounds with an overall Z&#39; factor of 0.58 +/- 0.12. A series of 3,5, di-substituted pyridines were identified as inhibitors of the cascade assay. These compounds did not inhibit a shortened activated MEK1 to ELK1 cascade but were active (0.5-27.9 microM) in a V600E BRAF assay and represent a potential starting point for future drug discovery and development.</p>

We identified a deletion affecting Rv1519 in CH, a strain isolated from a large outbreak in Leicester U.K., that coincidentally defines the East African-Indian lineage matching a major ethnic group in this city. In broth media, CH grew less rapidly and was less acidic and H2O2-tolerant than reference sequenced strains (CDC1551 and H37Rv). Nevertheless, CH was not impaired in its ability to grow in human monocyte-derived macrophages. When compared with CDC1551 and H37Rv, CH induced less protective IL-12p40 and more antiinflammatory IL-10 and IL-6 gene transcription and secretion from monocyte-derived macrophages. It thus appears that CH compensates microbiological attenuation by skewing the innate response toward phagocyte deactivation. Complementation of Rv1519, but none of nine additional genes absent from CH compared with the type strain, H37Rv, reversed the capacity of CH to elicit antiinflammatory IL-10 production by macrophages. The Rv1519 polymorphism in M. tuberculosis confers an immune subverting phenotype that contributes to the persistence and outbreak potential of this lineage.</p>

A number of international groups have used this approach to create sizeable public cell line repositories available to the scientific community for the generation of mutant mouse strains. The major gene trapping groups worldwide have recently joined together to centralize access to all publicly available gene trap lines by developing a user-oriented Website for the International Gene Trap Consortium (IGTC). This collaboration provides an impressive public informatics resource comprising approximately 45 000 well-characterized ES cell lines which currently represent approximately 40% of known mouse genes, all freely available for the creation of knockout mice on a non-collaborative basis. To standardize annotation and provide high confidence data for gene trap lines, a rigorous identification and annotation pipeline has been developed combining genomic localization and transcript alignment of gene trap sequence tags to identify trapped loci. This information is stored in a new bioinformatics database accessible through the IGTC Website interface. The IGTC Website (www.genetrap.org) allows users to browse and search the database for trapped genes, BLAST sequences against gene trap sequence tags, and view trapped genes within biological pathways. In addition, IGTC data have been integrated into major genome browsers and bioinformatics sites to provide users with outside portals for viewing this data. The development of the IGTC Website marks a major advance by providing the research community with the data and tools necessary to effectively use public gene trap resources for the large-scale characterization of mammalian gene function.</p>

We previously generated two Dmbx1 mutant alleles, Dmbx1 (-) and Dmbx1 ( z ), by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In this article we report the generation of three novel Dmbx1 mutant alleles, Dmbx1 (tauZ ), Dmbx1 (tauG ), and Dmbx1 ( Cre ), that carry the intronic insertion of tau (tau)-lacZ, tau-eGFP, and Cre reporter genes, respectively. Dmbx1 (tauZ ) and Dmbx1 (tauG ) recapitulated the Dmbx1 expression, and the reporter gene expression was detected in the diencephalon and mesencephalon during embryogenesis. The crossing of Dmbx1 ( Cre ) mice with Rosa26 reporter mice identified the Cre-mediated DNA excision in the postnatal midbrain, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. To maintain the Dmbx1 mutant alleles without genotyping, we crossed Dmbx1 mutant mice with Inv4(1) ( Brd ) mice that possess the inversion between D4Mit117 and D4Mit281 on Chromosome 4, where Dmbx1 is located. The intercrossing of the non-agouti (a/a) albino (Tyr ( c-Brd )/Tyr ( c-Brd )) Dmbx1 mutant mice carrying Inv4(1) ( Brd ) tagged with K14-Agouti and Tyrosinase coat-color markers resulted in the generation of dark brown Dmbx1 wild-type [Inv4(1) ( Brd )/Inv4(1) ( Brd )], light brown Dmbx1 heterozygous [Dmbx1 ( tm )/Inv4(1) ( Brd )], and albino Dmbx1 homozygous (Dmbx1 ( tm )/Dmbx1 ( tm )) mutant mice. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the proof-of-principle of the maintenance of viable gene-targeted alleles using coat-color-tagged nonlethal balancer chromosomes.</p>

These profiles showed many similarities to reported interferon-gamma-induced gene expression in normal CD34+ cells; indeed the 2 most up-regulated genes, IFIT1 and IFITM1, are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Alterations in the expression of ISGs may play a role in the hematologic features of MDS, such as peripheral blood cytopenias. Up-regulation of IFIT1 is a potential diagnostic marker for MDS. We determined whether distinct gene expression profiles were associated with specific FAB and cytogenetic groups. CD34+ cells from patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) showed a particular gene expression profile characterized by up-regulation of mitochondrial-related genes and, in particular, of those of heme synthesis (eg, ALAS2). CD34+ cells from patients with the del(5q) had a distinct gene expression profile, characterized by down-regulation of genes assigned to 5q, and up-regulation of the histone HIST1 gene cluster at chromosome 6p21 and of genes related to the actin cytoskeleton. This study provides important and new insights into the pathophysiology of MDS.</p>

The manual design of primers, however, can be cumbersome and error-prone. We have developed a straightforward web-based tool that applies user-specified inputs to automate and simplify the task of primer selection for deletion, tagging and/or regulated expression of genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This tool, named PPPP (for Pombe PCR Primer Programs), is available at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/PostGenomics/S_pombe/software/. We also present a searchable Microarray Primer Database to retrieve the sequences and accompanying information for primers and PCR products used to build our in-house Sz. pombe microarrays. This database contains information on both coding and intergenic regions to provide context for the microarray data, and it should be useful also for other applications, such as quantitative PCR.

Using a gene name from any of these organisms as a query, this database provides comprehensive, combined information on orthologs in other species using data from five independent resources: KOGs, Inparanoid, HomoloGene, OrthoMCL and a table of curated fission and budding yeast orthologs. Associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms of orthologs can also be retrieved for functional inference. Integrating these different and complementary datasets provides a straightforward tool to identify known and predicted orthologs of proteins from a variety of species. This resource should be useful for bench scientists looking for functional clues for their genes of interest as well as for curators looking for information that can be transferred based on orthology and for rapidly identifying the relevant GO terms as an aid to literature curation.

We have used two array-based comparative genomic hybridization platforms to identify a total of 355 copy number variants (CNVs) in the genomes of 20 wild-born chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and have compared the identified chimpanzee CNVs to known human CNVs from previous studies. Many CNVs were observed in the corresponding regions in both chimpanzees and humans; especially those CNVs of higher frequency. Strikingly, these loci are enriched 20-fold for ancestral segmental duplications, which may facilitate CNV formation through nonallelic homologous recombination mechanisms. Therefore, some of these regions may be unstable &quot;hotspots&quot; for the genesis of copy number variation, with recurrent duplications and deletions occurring across and within species.</p>

<p class="affiliation">ASM Scientific Ltd, Cambridge, United Kingdom.</p><p class="abstract">DNA amplification is essential to most nucleic acid testing strategies, but established techniques require sophisticated equipment or complex experimental procedures, and their uptake outside specialised laboratories has been limited. Our novel approach, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), couples isothermal recombinase-driven primer targeting of template material with strand-displacement DNA synthesis. It achieves exponential amplification with no need for pretreatment of sample DNA. Reactions are sensitive, specific, and rapid and operate at constant low temperature. We have also developed a probe-based detection system. Key aspects of the combined RPA amplification/detection process are illustrated by a test for the pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The technology proves to be sensitive to fewer than ten copies of genomic DNA. Furthermore, products can be detected in a simple sandwich assay, thereby establishing an instrument-free DNA testing system. This unique combination of properties is a significant advance in the development of portable and widely accessible nucleic acid-based tests.</p>

Archeological and linguistic analyses have suggested the settlers of Remote Oceania had ancestry in Taiwan, as descendants of a proposed Neolithic expansion that began approximately 5,500 years ago. Other researchers have suggested that the settlers were descendants of peoples from Island Southeast Asia or the existing inhabitants of Near Oceania alone. To explore patterns of maternal descent in Oceania, we have assembled and analyzed a data set of 137 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes from Oceania, Australia, Island Southeast Asia, and Taiwan that includes 19 sequences generated for this project. Using the MinMax Squeeze Approach (MMS), we report the consensus network of 165 most parsimonious trees for the Oceanic data set, increasing by many orders of magnitude the numbers of trees for which a provable minimal solution has been found. The new mtDNA sequences highlight the limitations of partial sequencing for assigning sequences to haplogroups and dating recent divergence events. The provably optimal trees found for the entire mtDNA sequences using the MMS method provide a reliable and robust framework for the interpretation of evolutionary relationships and confirm that the female settlers of Remote Oceania descended from both the existing inhabitants of Near Oceania and more recent migrants into the region.</p>

The stem cell leukemia gene (SCL/tal 1) encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for the normal development of blood progenitors and blood vessels. We have previously characterized a panel of SCL enhancers including the +19 element, which directs expression to hematopoietic stem cells and endothelium. Here we demonstrate that SCL is expressed in bone primordia during embryonic development and in adult osteoblasts. Despite consistent expression in cells of the osteogenic lineage, SCL protein is not required for bone specification of embryonic stem cells. In transgenic mice, the SCL +19 core enhancer directed reporter gene expression to vascular smooth muscle and bone in addition to blood and endothelium. A 644-bp fragment containing the SCL +19 core enhancer was active in both blood and bone cell lines and was bound in vivo by a common array of Ets and GATA transcription factors. Taken together with the recent observation that a common progenitor can give rise to blood and bone cells, our results suggest that the SCL +19 enhancer targets a mesodermal progenitor capable of generating hematopoietic, vascular, and osteoblastic progeny.</p>

While fundamental to neural information processing, behaviour and disease, the molecular organisation of the synapse and its relation to higher-level function has yet to be clearly understood. Neurotransmitter receptor complexes, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex (NRC/MASC), are major components of the synaptic proteome. We have recently completed a detailed study of MASC, its functional organisation and involvement in behaviour and disease. This pointed to simple design principles underlying synaptic organisation.

Neurotransmitter receptor complexes, such as the mammalian N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex (NRC/MASC) comprising 186 proteins, are major components of the synapse proteome. Here we investigate the organisation and function of NRC/MASC using a systems biology approach. Systematic annotation showed that the complex contained proteins implicated in a wide range of cognitive processes, synaptic plasticity and psychiatric diseases. Protein domains were evolutionarily conserved from yeast, but enriched with signalling domains associated with the emergence of multicellularity. Mapping of protein-protein interactions to create a network representation of the complex revealed that simple principles underlie the functional organisation of both proteins and their clusters, with modularity reflecting functional specialisation. The known functional roles of NRC/MASC proteins suggest the complex co-ordinates signalling to diverse effector pathways underlying neuronal plasticity. Importantly, using quantitative data from synaptic plasticity experiments, our model correctly predicts robustness to mutations and drug interference. These studies of synapse proteome organisation suggest that molecular networks with simple design principles underpin synaptic signalling properties with important roles in physiology, behaviour and disease.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Division of Developmental Biology, National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, UK.</p><p class="abstract">Laminins are major constituents of basement membranes and have wide ranging functions during development and in the adult. They are a family of heterotrimeric molecules created through association of an alpha, beta and gamma chain. We previously reported that two zebrafish loci, grumpy (gup) and sleepy (sly), encode laminin beta1 and gamma1, which are important both for notochord differentiation and for proper intersegmental blood vessel (ISV) formation. In this study we show that bashful (bal) encodes laminin alpha1 (lama1). Although the strongest allele, bal(m190), is fully penetrant, when compared to gup or sly mutant embryos, bal mutants are not as severely affected, as only anterior notochord fails to differentiate and ISVs are unaffected. This suggests that other alpha chains, and hence other isoforms, act redundantly to laminin 1 in posterior notochord and ISV development. We identified cDNA sequences for lama2, lama4 and lama5 and disrupted the expression of each alone or in mutant embryos also lacking laminin alpha1. When expression of laminin alpha4 and laminin alpha1 are simultaneously disrupted, notochord differentiation and ISVs are as severely affected as sly or gup mutants. Moreover, live imaging of transgenic embryos expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein in forming ISVs reveals that the vascular defects in these embryos are due to an inability of ISV sprouts to migrate correctly along the intersegmental, normally laminin-rich regions.</p>

Historically, the search for answers had focused on genetic or environmental variants, but recent studies in epigenetics have revealed a third mechanism that can influence phenotypic outcomes, even in the absence of genetic or environmental heterogeneity. Even more surprisingly, some epigenetic variants, or epialleles, can be inherited by the offspring, indicating the existence of a mechanism for biological heredity that is not based on DNA sequence. Recent work from mouse models, human monozygotic twin studies, and large-scale epigenetic profiling suggests that epigenetically determined phenotypes and epigenetic inheritance are more common than previously appreciated.</p>

The MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) aims to fulfil the need for an integrated source of information about these proteins. The organizational principle of the database is a hierarchical classification in which homologous sets of proteins of interest are grouped into families and the homologous families are grouped in clans. The most important addition to the database has been newly written, concise text annotations for each peptidase family. Other forms of information recently added include highlighting of active site residues (or the replacements that render some homologues inactive) in the sequence displays and BlastP search results, dynamically generated alignments and trees at the peptidase or inhibitor level, and a curated list of human and mouse homologues that have been experimentally characterized as active. A new way to display information at taxonomic levels higher than species has been devised. In the Literature pages, references have been flagged to draw attention to particularly &#39;hot&#39; topics.</p>

Recent advances in resolution of comparative genomic hybridization and genomic sequence annotation has identified new syndromes at chromosome 3q29 and 9q34. The finding of a significant number of copy number polymorphisms in the genome in the normal population, means that assigning pathogenicity to deletions and duplications in patients with mental retardation can be difficult but has been identified for duplications of MECP2 and L1CAM. Novel autosomal genes that cause mental retardation have been identified recently including CC2D1A identified by homozygosity mapping. Several new genes and pathways have been identified in the field of X-linked mental retardation but many more still await identification. Analysis of families where only a single male is affected reveals that the chance of this being due to a single X-linked gene abnormality is significantly less than would be expected if the excess of males in the population is entirely due to X-linked disease. Recent identification of novel X-linked mental retardation genes has identified components of the post-synaptic density and multiple zinc finger transcription factors as disease causing suggesting new mechanisms of disease causation. The first therapeutic treatments of animal models of mental retardation have been reported, a Drosophila model of Fragile X syndrome has been treated with lithium or metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonists and a mouse model of NF1 has been treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lavastatin, which improves the learning and memory skills in these models.</p>

The clinical phenotype includes macrocephaly, overgrowth and trigonocephaly. In addition, both children present with psychomotor delay, hyperactivity and distinctive facial features. Further analysis with a high-resolution custom microarray covering the whole breakpoint intervals with fosmids mapped the deletion breakpoints within 100-kb intervals: although the deletion boundaries are different for the two patients, nearly the same genes are deleted in both cases. We suggest therefore that microdeletion of 9q22.32-q22.33 is a novel cause of overgrowth and mental retardation. Its association with distinctive facial features should help in recognising this novel phenotype.</p>

We have constructed a first-generation CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Europe, Africa or Asia (the HapMap collection). DNA from these individuals was screened for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number variable regions (CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses, covering 360 megabases (12% of the genome) were identified in these populations. These CNVRs contained hundreds of genes, disease loci, functional elements and segmental duplications. Notably, the CNVRs encompassed more nucleotide content per genome than SNPs, underscoring the importance of CNV in genetic diversity and evolution. The data obtained delineate linkage disequilibrium patterns for many CNVs, and reveal marked variation in copy number among populations. We also demonstrate the utility of this resource for genetic disease studies.</p>

This protein, named Tectonic, is the founding member of a previously undescribed family of evolutionarily conserved secreted and transmembrane proteins. During neural tube development, mouse Tectonic is required for formation of the most ventral cell types and for full Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation. Epistasis analyses reveal that Tectonic modulates Hh signal transduction downstream of Smoothened (Smo) and Rab23. Interestingly, characterization of Tectonic Shh and Tectonic Smo double mutants indicates that Tectonic plays an additional role in repressing Hh pathway activity.</p>

We have identified and manually annotated 151 loci, of which 121 are known genes (predicted to be functional), 18 are pseudogenes, 8 are novel CDS loci, 3 are novel transcripts, and 1 is a putative gene. Nearly all of these loci have homologues in other mammalian genomes but orthologues could be identified with confidence for only 123 genes. The 28 genes (including all the SLA class I genes) for which unambiguous orthology to genes within the human reference MHC could not be established are of particular interest with respect to porcine-specific MHC function and evolution. We have compared the porcine MHC to other mammalian MHC regions and identified the differences between them. In comparison to the human MHC, the main differences include the absence of HLA-A and other class I-like loci, the absence of HLA-DP-like loci, and the separation of the extended and classical class II regions from the rest of the MHC by insertion of the centromere. We show that the centromere insertion has occurred within a cluster of BTNL genes located at the boundary of the class II and III regions, which might have resulted in the loss of an orthologue to human C6orf10 from this region.</p>

Although highly reliable, the major limitation remains the requirement for cell culture, resulting in a delay of as much as 14 days to obtaining test results. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR) rapidly detect common chromosomal abnormalities but do not provide a genome wide screen for unexpected imbalances. Array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) has the potential to combine the speed of DNA analysis with a large capacity to scan for genomic abnormalities. We have developed a genomic microarray of approximately 600 large insert clones designed to detect aneuploidy, known microdeletion syndromes, and large unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Methods</strong>: This array was tested alongside an array with an approximate resolution of 1 Mb in a blind study of 30 cultured prenatal and postnatal samples with microscopically confirmed unbalanced rearrangements.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: At 1 Mb resolution, 22/30 rearrangements were identified, whereas 29/30 aberrations were detected using the custom designed array, owing to the inclusion of specifically chosen clones to give increased resolution at genomic loci clinically implicated in known microdeletion syndromes. Both arrays failed to identify a triploid karyotype. Thirty normal control samples produced no false positive results.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Analysis of 30 uncultured prenatal samples showed that array CGH is capable of detecting aneuploidy in DNA isolated from as little as 1 ml of uncultured amniotic fluid; 29/30 samples were correctly diagnosed, the exception being another case of triploidy. These studies demonstrate the potential for array CGH to replace conventional cytogenetics in the great majority of prenatal diagnosis cases.</p>

Annotation of the genome of an organism entails identification of genes, the boundaries of genes in terms of precise start and end sites, and description of the gene products. Known and predicted functions were assigned to each gene product on the basis of experimental evidence or sequence analysis. Since both kinds of evidence are constantly expanding, no annotation is complete at any moment in time. This is a snapshot analysis based on the most recent genome sequences of two E.coli K-12 bacteria. An accurate and up-to-date description of E.coli K-12 genes is of particular importance to the scientific community because experimentally determined properties of its gene products provide fundamental information for annotation of innumerable genes of other organisms. Availability of the complete genome sequence of two K-12 strains allows comparison of their genotypes and mutant status of alleles.</p>

We demonstrate that a simple time lag model provides a general, parsimonious explanation of the extensive variation in the dN/dS ratio seen when comparing closely related bacterial genomes. We explore this model through simulation and comparative genomics, and suggest a role for hitch-hiking in the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations. We also note taxon-specific differences in the change of dN/dS over time, which may indicate variation in selection, or in population genetics parameters such as population size or the rate of recombination. The effect of comparing intra-species polymorphism and inter-species substitution, and the problems associated with these concepts for asexual prokaryotes, are also discussed. We conclude that, because of the critical effect of time since divergence, inter-taxa comparisons are only possible by comparing trajectories of dN/dS over time and it is not valid to compare taxa on the basis of single time points.</p>

This transcriptional response is also controlled by Csx1, an RNA-binding protein that directly associates with and stabilizes atf1(+) mRNA. Here we report the surprising observation that this response also requires Upf1, a component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) system. Accordingly, upf1Delta and csx1Delta strains are similarly sensitive to oxidative stress, and the effects of the mutations are not additive, suggesting that Upf1 and Csx1 work in the same pathway to stabilize atf1(+) mRNA during oxidative stress. Consistent with these observations, whole-genome expression profiling studies have shown that Upf1 controls the expression of more than 100 genes that are transcriptionally induced in response to oxidative stress, the large majority of which are also controlled by Atf1 and Csx1. The unexpected connection between an NMD factor and the oxidative stress response in fission yeast may provide important new clues about the physiological function of NMD in other species.</p>

In contrast with the mouse genome, which was sequenced and well characterized, the hamster species has been set aside. We constructed a chromosome paint set for the golden hamster, which for the first time allowed us to perform multidirectional chromosome painting between the golden hamster and the mouse and between the two species of hamster. From these data we constructed a detailed comparative chromosome map of the laboratory mouse and the two hamster species. The golden hamster painting probes revealed 25 autosomal segments in the Chinese hamster and 43 in the mouse. Using the Chinese hamster probes, 23 conserved segments were found in the golden hamster karyotype. The mouse probes revealed 42 conserved autosomal segments in the golden hamster karyotype. The two largest chromosomes of the Chinese hamster (1 and 2) are homologous to seven and five chromosomes of the golden hamster, respectively. The golden hamster karyotype can be transformed into the Chinese hamster karyotype by 15 fusions and 3 fissions. Previous reconstructions of the ancestral murid karyotype proposed diploid numbers from 2n = 52 to 2n = 54. By integrating the new multidirectional chromosome painting data presented here with previous comparative genomics data, we can propose that syntenies to mouse Chrs 6 and 16 were both present and to hypothesize a diploid number of 2n = 48 for the ancestral Murinae/Cricetinae karyotype.</p>

Yet, antibiotic-sensitive strains and haplotypes other than H58 still persist despite selection for antibiotic resistance. Neutral evolution in Typhi appears to reflect the asymptomatic carrier state, and adaptive evolution depends on the rapid transmission of phenotypic changes through acute infections.</p>

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IHC synaptic exocytosis are largely unknown. We studied otoferlin, a predicted C2-domain transmembrane protein, which is defective in a recessive form of human deafness. We show that otoferlin expression in the hair cells correlates with afferent synaptogenesis and find that otoferlin localizes to ribbon-associated synaptic vesicles. Otoferlin binds Ca(2+) and displays Ca(2+)-dependent interactions with the SNARE proteins syntaxin1 and SNAP25. Otoferlin deficient mice (Otof(-/-)) are profoundly deaf. Exocytosis in Otof(-/-) IHCs is almost completely abolished, despite normal ribbon synapse morphogenesis and Ca(2+) current. Thus, otoferlin is essential for a late step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and may act as the major Ca(2+) sensor triggering membrane fusion at the IHC ribbon synapse.</p>

About 80% of ductal cancers (IDCs) and all lobular cancers (ILCs) lost at least part of 16q. Grade I (GI) IDCs and ILCs often lost the whole chromosome arm. Grade II (GII) and grade III (GIII) IDCs showed less frequent whole-arm loss, but often had complex changes, typically small regions of gain together with larger regions of loss. The boundaries of gains/losses tended to cluster, common sites being 54.5-55.5 Mb and 57.4-58.8 Mb. Overall, the peak frequency of loss (83% cancers) occurred at 61.9-62.9 Mb. We also found several &#39;minimal&#39; regions of loss/gain. However, no mutations in candidate genes (TRADD, CDH5, CDH8 and CDH11) were detected. Cluster analysis based on copy number changes identified a large group of cancers that had lost most of 16q, and two smaller groups (one with few changes, one with a tendency to show copy number gain). Although all morphological types occurred in each cluster group, IDCs (especially GII/GIII) were relatively overrepresented in the smaller groups. Cluster groups were not independently associated with survival. Use of tiling-path aCGH prompted re-evaluation of the hypothetical pathways of breast carcinogenesis. ILCs have the simplest changes on 16q and probably diverge from the IDC lineage close to the stage of 16q loss. Higher-grade IDCs probably develop from low-grade lesions in most cases, but there remains evidence that some GII/GIII IDCs arise without a GI precursor.</p>

In the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, the synthesis of virulence factors and dispersal of biofilms are positively controlled by a two-component signal transduction system comprising the HD-GYP domain regulatory protein RpfG and cognate sensor RpfC and by cell-cell signaling mediated by the diffusible signal molecule DSF (diffusible signal factor). The RpfG/RpfC two-component system has been implicated in DSF perception and signal transduction. Here we show that the role of RpfG is to degrade the unusual nucleotide cyclic di-GMP, an activity associated with the HD-GYP domain. Mutation of the conserved H and D residues of the isolated HD-GYP domain resulted in loss of both the enzymatic activity against cyclic di-GMP and the regulatory activity in virulence factor synthesis. Two other protein domains, GGDEF and EAL, are already implicated in the synthesis and degradation respectively of cyclic di-GMP. As with GGDEF and EAL domains, the HD-GYP domain is widely distributed in free-living bacteria and occurs in plant and animal pathogens, as well as beneficial symbionts and organisms associated with a range of environmental niches. Identification of the role of the HD-GYP domain thus increases our understanding of a signaling network whose importance to the lifestyle of diverse bacteria is now emerging.</p>

To investigate the potential of plants to remove RDX from contaminated soil and water, we engineered Arabidopsis thaliana to express a bacterial gene xplA encoding an RDX-degrading cytochrome P450 (ref. 1). We demonstrate that the P450 domain of XplA is fused to a flavodoxin redox partner and catalyzes the degradation of RDX in the absence of oxygen. Transgenic A. thaliana expressing xplA removed and detoxified RDX from liquid media. As a model system for RDX phytoremediation, A. thaliana expressing xplA was grown in RDX-contaminated soil and found to be resistant to RDX phytotoxicity, producing shoot and root biomasses greater than those of wild-type plants. Our work suggests that expression of xplA in landscape plants may provide a suitable remediation strategy for sites contaminated by this class of explosives.</p>

They are expressed on natural killer and T cells, and interact with human leukocyte antigens. KIR genes are highly polymorphic and contribute vital variability to our immune system. Numerous KIR genes, belonging to five distinct lineages, have been identified in all primates examined thus far and shown to be rapidly evolving. Since few KIR remain orthologous between species, with only one of them, KIR2DL4, shown to be common to human, apes and monkeys, the evolution of the KIR gene family in primates remains unclear.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: Using comparative analyses, we have identified the ancestral KIR lineage (provisionally named KIR3DL0) in primates. We show KIR3DL0 to be highly conserved with the identification of orthologues in human (Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We predict KIR3DL0 to encode a functional molecule in all primates by demonstrating expression in human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. Using the rhesus monkey as a model, we further show the expression profile to be typical of KIR by quantitative measurement of KIR3DL0 from an enriched population of natural killer cells.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: One reason why KIR3DL0 may have escaped discovery for so long is that, in human, it maps in between two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor clusters outside the known KIR gene cluster on Chromosome 19. Based on genomic, cDNA, expression and phylogenetic data, we report a novel lineage of immunoglobulin receptors belonging to the KIR family, which is highly conserved throughout 50 million years of primate evolution.</p>

Arbitrarily complex, user-specified queries are now possible through Textpresso (for all available literature) and through WormMart (for most genomic data). Biological content was enriched by reconciling all available cDNA and expressed sequence tag data with gene predictions, clarifying single nucleotide polymorphism and RNAi sites, and summarizing known functions for most genes studied in this organism.</p>

In order to understand the evolutionary relatedness of Bordetella species and further the understanding of pathogenesis, we obtained the complete genome sequence of B. avium strain 197N, a pathogenic strain that has been extensively studied. With 3,732,255 base pairs of DNA and 3,417 predicted coding sequences, it has the smallest genome and gene complement of the sequenced bordetellae. In this study, the presence or absence of previously reported virulence factors from B. avium was confirmed, and the genetic bases for growth characteristics were elucidated. Over 1,100 genes present in B. avium but not in B. bronchiseptica were identified, and most were predicted to encode surface or secreted proteins that are likely to define an organism adapted to the avian rather than the mammalian respiratory tracts. These include genes coding for the synthesis of a polysaccharide capsule, hemagglutinins, a type I secretion system adjacent to two very large genes for secreted proteins, and unique genes for both lipopolysaccharide and fimbrial biogenesis. Three apparently complete prophages are also present. The BvgAS virulence regulatory system appears to have polymorphisms at a poly(C) tract that is involved in phase variation in other bordetellae. A number of putative iron-regulated outer membrane proteins were predicted from the sequence, and this regulation was confirmed experimentally for five of these.</p>

Our analysis indicates that a large proportion (11%) of the genome consists of mobile genetic elements, mainly in the form of conjugative transposons. These mobile elements are putatively responsible for the acquisition by C. difficile of an extensive array of genes involved in antimicrobial resistance, virulence, host interaction and the production of surface structures. The metabolic capabilities encoded in the genome show multiple adaptations for survival and growth within the gut environment. The extreme genome variability was confirmed by whole-genome microarray analysis; it may reflect the organism&#39;s niche in the gut and should provide information on the evolution of virulence in this organism.</p>

The prevalence of Scc2 orthologs in eukaryotes emphasizes a conserved role in regulating sister chromatid cohesion, but homologs of Scc4 have not hitherto been identified outside certain fungi. Some metazoan orthologs of Scc2 were initially identified as developmental gene regulators, such as Drosophila Nipped-B, a regulator of cut and Ultrabithorax, and delangin, a protein mutant in Cornelia de Lange syndrome. We show that delangin and Nipped-B bind previously unstudied human and fly orthologs of Caenorhabditis elegans MAU-2, a non-axis-specific guidance factor for migrating cells and axons. PSI-BLAST shows that Scc4 is evolutionarily related to metazoan MAU-2 sequences, with the greatest homology evident in a short N-terminal domain, and protein-protein interaction studies map the site of interaction between delangin and human MAU-2 to the N-terminal regions of both proteins. Short interfering RNA knockdown of human MAU-2 in HeLa cells resulted in precocious sister chromatid separation and in impaired loading of cohesin onto chromatin, indicating that it is functionally related to Scc4, and RNAi analyses show that MAU-2 regulates chromosome segregation in C. elegans embryos. Using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to knock down Xenopus tropicalis delangin or MAU-2 in early embryos produced similar patterns of retarded growth and developmental defects. Our data show that sister chromatid cohesion in metazoans involves the formation of a complex similar to the Scc2-Scc4 interaction in the budding yeast. The very high degree of sequence conservation between Scc4 homologs in complex metazoans is consistent with increased selection pressure to conserve additional essential functions, such as regulation of cell and axon migration during development.</p>

Indraprastha University, Kashmere Gate, Delhi, 110006, India.</p><p class="abstract">RNA polymerase II is a complex of 12 subunits, Rpb1 to Rpb12, whose specific roles are only partly understood. Rpb4 is essential in mammals and fission yeast, but not in budding yeast. To learn more about the roles of Rpb4, we expressed the rpb4 gene under the control of regulatable promoters of different strength in fission yeast. We demonstrate that below a critical level of transcription, Rpb4 affects cellular growth proportional to its expression levels: cells expressing lower levels of rpb4 grew slower compared to cells expressing higher levels. Lowered rpb4 expression did not affect cell survival under several stress conditions, but it caused specific defects in cell separation similar to sep mutants. Microarray analysis revealed that lowered rpb4 expression causes a global reduction in gene expression, but the transcript levels of a distinct subset of genes were particularly responsive to changes in rpb4 expression. These genes show some overlap with those regulated by the Sep1-Ace2 transcriptional cascade required for cell separation. Most notably, the gene expression signature of cells with lowered rpb4 expression was highly similar to those of mcs6, pmh1, sep10 and sep15 mutants. Mcs6 and Pmh1 encode orthologs of metazoan TFIIH-associated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (Cdk7-cyclin H-Mat1), while Sep10 and Sep15 encode mediator components. Our results suggest that Rpb4, along with some other general transcription factors, plays a specialized role in a transcriptional pathway that controls the cell cycle-regulated transcription of a specific subset of genes involved in cell division.</p>

Here, we describe three individuals with learning disability and a heterozygous deletion at chromosome 17q21.3, detected in each case by array CGH. FISH analysis demonstrated that the deletions occurred as de novo events in each individual and were between 500 kb and 650 kb in size. A recently described 900-kb inversion that suppresses recombination between ancestral H1 and H2 haplotypes encompasses the deletion. We show that, in each trio, the parent of origin of the deleted chromosome 17 carries at least one H2 chromosome. This region of 17q21.3 shows complex genomic architecture with well-described low-copy repeats (LCRs). The orientation of LCRs flanking the deleted segment in inversion heterozygotes is likely to facilitate the generation of this microdeletion by means of non-allelic homologous recombination.</p>

To search for further breast cancer susceptibility genes, we performed a combined analysis of four genome-wide linkage screens, which included a total of 149 multiple case breast cancer families. All families included at least three cases of breast cancer diagnosed below age 60 years, at least one of whom had been tested and found not to carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Evidence for linkage was assessed using parametric linkage analysis, assuming both a dominant and a recessive mode of inheritance, and using nonparametric methods. The highest LOD score obtained in any analysis of the combined data was 1.80 under the dominant model, in a region on chromosome 4 close to marker D4S392. Three further LOD scores over 1 were identified in the parametric analyses and two in the nonparametric analyses. A maximum LOD score of 2.40 was found on chromosome arm 2p in families with four or more cases of breast cancer diagnosed below age 50 years. The number of linkage peaks did not differ from the number expected by chance. These results suggest regions that may harbor novel breast cancer susceptibility genes. They also indicate that no single gene is likely to account for a large fraction of the familial aggregation of breast cancer that is not due to mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.</p>

The brown deletion complex comprises &gt;28 independent genome rearrangements, which have been used to identify several functional loci on chromosome 4 required for normal embryonic and postnatal development. We have constructed a 172-bacterial artificial chromosome contig that spans this 22-megabase (Mb) interval and have produced a contiguous, finished, and manually annotated sequence from these clones. The deletion complex is strikingly gene-poor, containing only 52 protein-coding genes (of which only 39 are supported by human homologues) and has several further notable genomic features, including several segments of &gt;1 Mb, apparently devoid of a coding sequence. We have used sequence polymorphisms to finely map the deletion breakpoints and identify strong candidate genes for the known phenotypes that map to this region, including three lethal loci (l4Rn1, l4Rn2, and l4Rn3) and the fitness mutant brown-associated fitness (baf). We have also characterized misexpression of the basonuclin homologue, Bnc2, associated with the inversion-mediated coat color mutant white-based brown (B(w)). This study provides a molecular insight into the basis of several characterized mouse mutants, which will allow further dissection of this region by targeted or chemical mutagenesis.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.</p><p class="abstract">In humans, the rate of recombination, as measured on the megabase scale, is positively associated with the level of genetic variation, as measured at the genic scale. Despite considerable debate, it is not clear whether these factors are causally linked or, if they are, whether this is driven by the repeated action of adaptive evolution or molecular processes such as double-strand break formation and mismatch repair. We introduce three innovations to the analysis of recombination and diversity: fine-scale genetic maps estimated from genotype experiments that identify recombination hotspots at the kilobase scale, analysis of an entire human chromosome, and the use of wavelet techniques to identify correlations acting at different scales. We show that recombination influences genetic diversity only at the level of recombination hotspots. Hotspots are also associated with local increases in GC content and the relative frequency of GC-increasing mutations but have no effect on substitution rates. Broad-scale association between recombination and diversity is explained through covariance of both factors with base composition. To our knowledge, these results are the first evidence of a direct and local influence of recombination hotspots on genetic variation and the fate of individual mutations. However, that hotspots have no influence on substitution rates suggests that they are too ephemeral on an evolutionary time scale to have a strong influence on broader scale patterns of base composition and long-term molecular evolution.</p>

One hundred randomly selected amastigote-expressed genes were screened as DNA vaccines, and efficacy determined following high-dose L. major footpad challenge in BALB/c mice. Fourteen protective novel vaccine candidates were identified; seven vaccines exacerbated disease. There were no differences in the number of predicted MHC H-2d class I or II epitopes mapping to protective versus exacerbatory antigens. A proportion of both protective (7/14; 50%) and exacerbatory (4/7; 57%) proteins showed short (8- to 18-mer) 100% amino acid sequence identities to human, mouse or gut flora proteins. A high proportion of these (4/7 protective; 3/4 exacerbatory) showed full or partial overlap with RANKPEP-predicted H-2d classes I and II epitopes. Our data suggest, therefore, that there may be little difference between antigens/epitopes that drive regulatory versus effector CD4 T cell populations. The best novel protective antigen was an amastin-like gene that maps to a 17-gene tandem array on Leishmania chromosome 8 and is closely related to 37 other amastin-like genes. Two ribosomal proteins, a V-ATPase subunit, and a dynein light chain orthologue were the only other protective genes with putative functions.</p>

This is a complex problem, often involving contributions from multiple loci and their interactions, as well as effects due to environmental factors. Although some diseases with a genetic basis are caused by nucleotide changes that alter an amino acid sequence, in other cases, disease risk is associated with altered gene regulation. This paper focuses on how studies of gene expression variation might complement disease studies and provide crucial links between genotype and phenotype.</p>

A single copy of the DNA construct can be inserted by targeting into regions of chromatin that allow the desired developmental and tissue-specific expression of the transgene.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Methodology</strong>: In order to develop a reliable system for reproducibly expressing transgenes it was decided to insert constructs at the Gt(ROSA)26Sor locus. A cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was used to drive expression of the Tetracycline (tet) transcriptional activator, rtTA2(s)-M2, and test the effectiveness of using the ROSA26 locus to allow transgene expression. The tet operator construct was inserted into one allele of ROSA26 and a tet responder construct controlling expression of EGFP was inserted into the other allele.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Expression of the targeted transgenes was shown to be affected by both the presence of selectable marker cassettes and by the orientation of the transgenes with respect to the endogenous ROSA26 promoter. These results suggest that transcriptional interference from the endogenous gene promoter or from promoters in the selectable marker cassettes may be affecting transgene expression at the locus. Additionally we have been able to determine the optimal orientation for transgene expression at the ROSA26 locus.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Signal Transduction Laboratory, UK.</p><p class="abstract">Sensitivity to Her2-directed therapies is complex and involves expression not only of Her2 but also of other epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members, their ligands, and molecules that influence pathway activity, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, PTEN, and p27. The EGFR experience has taught us that responses can easily be diluted in an unselected cohort of patients. To date, trials of Her2-targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab, have been insufficiently powered to determine whether patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Her2 gene amplification (rather than overexpression by immunohistochemistry) may benefit from these agents. It is unclear whether agents targeting Her2 might prove successful in future clinical trials in a highly selected patient cohort, either with Her2 amplification or Her2 gene mutations. The frequency of Her2 mutations in NSCLC may be too low to justify a prospective clinical trial in this patient group. The frequency of Her2 amplification (2-23%) in NSCLC and the widespread availability of Her2 fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis may justify a final study of trastuzumab monotherapy in this patient population. The role played by Her2 as the obligate heterodimerization partner for the other EGFR family members renders Her2 an attractive target irrespective of receptor overexpression. The most promising Her2-targeted strategy will likely prove to be combinatorial approaches using an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor together with Her2 dimerization inhibitors.</p>

AP1S2 encodes an adaptin protein that constitutes part of the adaptor protein complex found at the cytoplasmic face of coated vesicles located at the Golgi complex. The complex mediates the recruitment of clathrin to the vesicle membrane. Aberrant endocytic processing through disruption of adaptor protein complexes is likely to result from the AP1S2 mutations identified in the three XLMR-affected families, and such defects may plausibly cause abnormal synaptic development and function. AP1S2 is the first reported XLMR gene that encodes a protein directly involved in the assembly of endocytic vesicles.</p>

Initial gene annotation indicates an average gene density of 11.6 genes per megabase, including 1,524 protein-coding genes, some of which were identified using novel methods, and 765 pseudogenes. One-quarter of the protein-coding genes shows overlap with other genes. Of the 856 olfactory receptor genes in the human genome, more than 40% are located in 28 single- and multi-gene clusters along this chromosome. Out of the 171 disorders currently attributed to the chromosome, 86 remain for which the underlying molecular basis is not yet known, including several mendelian traits, cancer and susceptibility loci. The high-quality data presented here--nearly 134.5 million base pairs representing 99.8% coverage of the euchromatic sequence--provide scientists with a solid foundation for understanding the genetic basis of these disorders and other biological phenomena.</p>

However, purification of GPCRs for biochemical study is difficult and current methods of studying receptor-ligand interactions involve in vitro systems. Caenorhabditis elegans is a soil-dwelling, bacteria-feeding nematode that uses GPCRs expressed in chemosensory neurons to detect bacteria and environmental compounds, making this an ideal system for studying in vivo GPCR-ligand interactions. We sought to test this by functionally expressing two medically important mammalian GPCRs, somatostatin receptor 2 (Sstr2) and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the gustatory neurons of C. elegans.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: Expression of Sstr2 and CCR5 in gustatory neurons allow C. elegans to specifically detect and respond to somatostatin and MIP-1alpha respectively in a robust avoidance assay. We demonstrate that mammalian heterologous GPCRs can signal via different endogenous Galpha subunits in C. elegans, depending on which cells it is expressed in. Furthermore, pre-exposure of GPCR transgenic animals to its ligand leads to receptor desensitisation and behavioural adaptation to subsequent ligand exposure, providing further evidence of integration of the mammalian GPCRs into the C. elegans sensory signalling machinery. In structure-function studies using a panel of somatostatin-14 analogues, we identified key residues involved in the interaction of somatostatin-14 with Sstr2.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results illustrate a remarkable evolutionary plasticity in interactions between mammalian GPCRs and C. elegans signalling machinery, spanning 800 million years of evolution. This in vivo system, which imparts novel avoidance behaviour on C. elegans, thus provides a simple means of studying and screening interaction of GPCRs with extracellular agonists, antagonists and intracellular binding partners.</p>

It has also been suggested to increase risks of colorectal and prostate cancer, but its involvement with these or other types of cancer has not been confirmed. The incidence of cancer other than breast cancer in 11,116 individuals from 734 non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer families from the United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, and the United States was compared with that predicted by population rates. Relative risks (RR) to carriers and noncarriers were estimated by maximum likelihood, via the expectation-maximization algorithm to allow for unknown genotypes. Sixty-seven families contained at least one tested CHEK2 1100delC mutation carrier. There was evidence of underreporting of cancers in male relatives (422 cancers observed, 860 expected) but not in females (322 observed, 335 expected); hence, we focused on cancer risks in female carriers. The risk of cancers other than breast cancer in female carriers was not significantly elevated, although a modest increase in risk could not be excluded (RR, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-2.17). The carrier risk was not significantly raised for any individual cancer site, including colorectal cancer (RR, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-4.71). However, between ages 20 to 50 years, the risks of colorectal and lung cancer were both higher in female carriers than noncarriers (P = 0.041 and 0.0001, respectively). There was no evidence of a higher prostate cancer risk in carriers than noncarriers (P = 0.26), although underreporting of male cancers limited our power to detect such a difference. Our results suggest that the risk of cancer associated with CHEK2 1100delC mutations is restricted to breast cancer, although we cannot rule out a small increase in overall cancer risk.</p>

Comparison at the genomic level is a key step in our understanding of the genetic basis for this pathogenicity spectrum. Here we report the genome of Y. enterocolitica strain 8081 (serotype 0:8; biotype 1B) and extensive microarray data relating to the genetic diversity of the Y. enterocolitica species. Our analysis reveals that the genome of Y. enterocolitica strain 8081 is a patchwork of horizontally acquired genetic loci, including a plasticity zone of 199 kb containing an extraordinarily high density of virulence genes. Microarray analysis has provided insights into species-specific Y. enterocolitica gene functions and the intraspecies differences between the high, low, and nonpathogenic Y. enterocolitica biotypes. Through comparative genome sequence analysis we provide new information on the evolution of the Yersinia. We identify numerous loci that represent ancestral clusters of genes potentially important in enteric survival and pathogenesis, which have been lost or are in the process of being lost, in the other sequenced Yersinia lineages. Our analysis also highlights large metabolic operons in Y. enterocolitica that are absent in the related enteropathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, indicating major differences in niche and nutrients used within the mammalian gut. These include clusters directing, the production of hydrogenases, tetrathionate respiration, cobalamin synthesis, and propanediol utilisation. Along with ancestral gene clusters, the genome of Y. enterocolitica has revealed species-specific and enteropathogen-specific loci. This has provided important insights into the pathology of this bacterium and, more broadly, into the evolution of the genus. Moreover, wider investigations looking at the patterns of gene loss and gain in the Yersinia have highlighted common themes in the genome evolution of other human enteropathogens.</p>

RAD52 is the archetype in an epistasis group of genes essential for DNA damage repair. By catalyzing the replacement of replication protein A with Rad51 on single-stranded DNA, Rad52 likely promotes strand invasion of a double-stranded DNA molecule by single-stranded DNA. Although the sequence and in vitro functions of mammalian RAD52 are conserved with those of yeast, one difference is the presence of introns and consequent splicing of the mammalian RAD52 pre-mRNA. We identified two novel splice variants from the RAD52 gene that are expressed in adult mouse tissues. Expression of these splice variants in tissue culture cells elevates the frequency of recombination that uses a sister chromatid template. To characterize this dominant phenotype further, the RAD52 gene from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was truncated to model the mammalian splice variants. The same dominant sister chromatid recombination phenotype seen in mammalian cells was also observed in yeast. Furthermore, repair from a homologous chromatid is reduced in yeast, implying that the choice of alternative repair pathways may be controlled by these variants. In addition, a dominant DNA repair defect induced by one of the variants in yeast is suppressed by overexpression of RAD51, suggesting that the Rad51-Rad52 interaction is impaired.</p>

Advancement in identification of MHC genes that confer susceptibility to disease requires greater knowledge of sequence variation across the complex. Highly duplicated and polymorphic regions of the human genome such as the MHC are, however, somewhat refractory to some whole-genome analysis methods. To address this issue, we are employing a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning strategy to sequence entire MHC haplotypes from consanguineous cell lines as part of the MHC Haplotype Project. Here we present 4.25 Mb of the human haplotype QBL (HLA-A26-B18-Cw5-DR3-DQ2) and compare it with the MHC reference haplotype and with a second haplotype, COX (HLA-A1-B8-Cw7-DR3-DQ2), that shares the same HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 alleles. We have defined the complete gene, splice variant, and sequence variation contents of all three haplotypes, comprising over 259 annotated loci and over 20,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Certain coding sequences vary significantly between different haplotypes, making them candidates for functional and disease-association studies. Analysis of the two DR3 haplotypes allowed delineation of the shared sequence between two HLA class II-related haplotypes differing in disease associations and the identification of at least one of the sites that mediated the original recombination event. The levels of variation across the MHC were similar to those seen for other HLA-disparate haplotypes, except for a 158-kb segment that contained the HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 genes and showed very limited polymorphism compatible with identity-by-descent and relatively recent common ancestry (&lt;3,400 generations). These results indicate that the differential disease associations of these two DR3 haplotypes are due to sequence variation outside this central 158-kb segment, and that shuffling of ancestral blocks via recombination is a potential mechanism whereby certain DR-DQ allelic combinations, which presumably have favoured immunological functions, can spread across haplotypes and populations.</p>

Our results describe novel interactions between known components of the human ESCRT III complex and identify a range of putative binding partners, which may indicate new ways in which the function of human CHMP proteins may be regulated. In particular, we show that two further MIT domain-containing proteins (AMSH/STAMBP and LOC129531) interact with multiple components of the human ESCRT III complex.</p>

This is the first time that this approach has been used in Salmonella and abrogates the need for selection with quinolone antibacterials in the investigation of resistance mutations.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: A panel of mutants was created using this methodology and tested for quinolone resistance. The ParC substitution alone made no difference to quinolone susceptibility. Any single GyrA substitution resulted in resistance to nalidixic acid (MIC &gt;or= 512 mg/L) and increased by up to 23-fold the MIC of the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin (MIC &lt;or= 2 mg/L) ciprofloxacin (MIC &lt;or= 1 mg/L) and gatifloxacin (MIC &lt;or= 0.38 mg/L). Among the double substitution mutants, those with a substitution in ParC were less prone to killing with ciprofloxacin. The triple substitution mutants (Ser-83--&gt;Phe or Tyr and Asp-87--&gt;Asn in GyrA with Glu-84--&gt;Lys in ParC) showed high levels of resistance to all the fluoroquinolones tested (MICs: gatifloxacin, 3-4 mg/L; ofloxacin, 32 mg/L; ciprofloxacin, 32-64 mg/L).</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusions</strong>: In Salmonella Typhi the fluoroquinolones tested act on GyrA and, at higher concentrations, on ParC. The point mutations conferred reduced susceptibility to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also reduced susceptibility to gatifloxacin. Three mutations conferred resistance to ofloxacin (32 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (32 mg/L) and to the more active fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin (MIC &gt;or= 3 mg/L). These results predict that the use of ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin will select for resistance to gatifloxacin in nature.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.</p><p class="abstract">Multiplexed amplification of specific DNA sequences, by PCR or by strand-displacement amplification, is an intrinsically biased process. The relative abundance of amplified DNA can be altered significantly from the original representation and, in extreme cases, allele dropout can occur. In this paper, we present a method of linear amplification of DNA that relies on the cooperative, sequence-dependent functioning of the DNA mismatch-repair enzyme endonuclease V (EndoV) from Thermotoga maritima (Tma) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase. Tma EndoV can nick one strand of unmodified duplex DNA, allowing extension by Bst polymerase. By controlling the bases surrounding a mismatch and the mismatch itself, the efficiency of nicking by EndoV and extension by Bst polymerase can be controlled. The method currently allows 100-fold multiplexed amplification of target molecules to be performed isothermally, with an average change of &lt;1.3-fold in their original representation. Because only a single primer is necessary, primer artefacts and nonspecific amplification products are minimized.</p>

We have developed a method called &#39;haplotype fusion&#39; in which an inversion breakpoint is genotyped by performing fusion PCR on single molecules of human genomic DNA. Fusing single-copy sequences bracketing an inversion breakpoint generates orientation-specific PCR products, exemplified by a genotyping assay for the int22 hemophilia A inversion on Xq28. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inversion events with breakpoints embedded within long (&gt;100 kb) inverted repeats can be genotyped by haplotype-fusion PCR followed by bead-based single-molecule haplotyping on repeat-specific markers bracketing the inversion breakpoint. We illustrate this method by genotyping a Yp paracentric inversion sponsored by &gt;300-kb-long inverted repeats. The generality of our methods to survey for, and genotype chromosomal inversions should help our understanding of the contribution of inversions to genomic variation, inherited diseases and cancer.</p>

Recent technological advances have led to the discovery of copy-number changes previously undetected by cytogenetic techniques. To understand the genetic consequences of such genomic changes, these mutations need to be modeled in experimentally tractable systems. The mouse is an excellent organism for this analysis because of its biological and genetic similarity to humans, and the ease with which its genome can be manipulated. Through chromosome engineering, defined rearrangements can be introduced into the mouse genome. The resulting mouse models are leading to a better understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of dosage alterations in human disease phenotypes, in turn opening new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.</p>

Using embryonic stem cell technology to generate a null mutation of Tslc1 in mice, we found that Tslc1 null male mice were infertile. Tslc1 null adult testes showed that spermatogenesis had arrested at the spermatid stage, with degenerating and apoptotic spermatids sloughing off into the lumen. In adult mice, Tslc1 null round spermatids showed evidence of normal differentiation (an acrosomal cap and F-actin polarization indistinguishable from that of wild-type spermatids); however, the surviving spermatozoa were immature, malformed, found at very low levels in the epididymis, and rarely motile. Analysis of the first wave of spermatogenesis in Tslc1 null mice showed a delay in maturation by day 22 and degeneration of round spermatids by day 28. Expression profiling of the testes revealed that Tslc1 null mice showed increases in the expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis, adhesion, and the cytoskeleton. Taken together, these data show that Tslc1 is essential for normal spermatogenesis in mice.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Mouse Genomics Lab, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.</p><p class="abstract">Mutations in the gene encoding matrilin-3 (MATN3), a noncollagenous extracellular matrix protein, have been reported in a variety of skeletal diseases, including multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which is characterized by irregular ossification of the epiphyses and early-onset osteoarthritis, spondylo-epimetaphyseal dysplasia, and idiopathic hand osteoarthritis. To assess the role of matrilin-3 in the pathogenesis of these diseases, we generated Matn3 functional knockout mice using embryonic stem cell technology. In the embryonic growth plate of the developing long bones, Matn3 null chondrocytes prematurely became prehypertrophic and hypertrophic, forming an expanded zone of hypertrophy. This expansion was attenuated during the perinatal period, and Matn3 homozygous null mice were viable and showed no gross skeletal malformations at birth. However, by 18 weeks of age, Matn3 null mice had a significantly higher total body bone mineral density than Matn1 null mice or wild-type littermates. Aged Matn3 null mice were much more predisposed to develop severe osteoarthritis than their wild-type littermates. Here, we show that matrilin-3 plays a role in modulating chondrocyte differentiation during embryonic development, in controlling bone mineral density in adulthood, and in preventing osteoarthritis during aging. The lack of Matn3 does not lead to postnatal chondrodysplasia but accounts for higher incidence of osteoarthritis.</p>

Dietary Cl(-) restriction upregulates total pendrin protein expression. Whether the subcellular expression of pendrin and whether the apparent vascular volume contraction observed in Slc26a4 null mice are Cl(-) dependent, but Na(+) independent, is unknown. Thus the subcellular distribution of pendrin and its role in acid-base and fluid balance were explored using immunogold cytochemistry and balance studies of mice ingesting a NaCl-replete or a Na(+)-replete, Cl(-)-restricted diet, achieved through substitution of NaCl with NaHCO(3). Boundary length and apical plasma membrane pendrin label density each increased by approximately 60-70% in type B intercalated cells, but not in non-A, non-B cells, whereas cytoplasmic pendrin immunolabel increased approximately 60% in non-A, non-B intercalated cells, but not in type B cells. Following either NaCl restriction or Cl(-) restriction alone, Slc26a4 null mice excreted more Cl(-) and had a higher arterial pH than pair-fed wild-type mice. In conclusion, 1) following dietary Cl(-) restriction, apical plasma membrane pendrin immunolabel increases in type B intercalated cells, but not in non-A, non-B intercalated cells; and 2) pendrin participates in the regulation of renal Cl(-) excretion and arterial pH during dietary Cl(-) restriction.</p>

Such approaches rely only on sequence information and utilize different low and high order indices to capture compositional deviation from the genome backbone; the superiority of the latter over the former has been shown elsewhere. However even high order k-mers may be poor estimators of HGT, when insufficient information is available, e.g. in short sliding windows. Most of the current HGT prediction methods require pre-existing annotation, which may restrict their application on newly sequenced genomes.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: We introduce a novel computational method, Interpolated Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs), which exploits compositional biases using variable order motif distributions and captures more reliably the local composition of a sequence compared with fixed-order methods. For optimal localization of the boundaries of each predicted region, a second order, two-state hidden Markov model (HMM) is implemented in a change-point detection framework. We applied the IVOM approach to the genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18, a well-studied prokaryote in terms of HGT events, and we show that the IVOMs outperform state-of-the-art low and high order motif methods predicting not only the already characterized Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI-1 to SPI-10) but also three novel SPIs (SPI-15, SPI-16, SPI-17) and other HGT events.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Availability</strong>: The software is available under a GPL license as a standalone application at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/alien_hunter</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Contact</strong>: <a href="mailto:%67%73%76%40%73%61%6E%67%65%72.%61%63.%75%6B">&#103;&#115;&#118;&#64;&#115;&#97;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a></p><p class="abstract">Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</p>

Most cases are reported from northeast Thailand and northern Australia. Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we have compared (i) soil and invasive isolates from northeast Thailand and (ii) invasive isolates from Thailand and Australia. A total of 266 Thai B. pseudomallei isolates were characterized (83 soil and 183 invasive). These corresponded to 123 sequence types (STs), the most abundant being ST70 (n=21), ST167 (n=15), ST54 (n=12), and ST58 (n=11). Two clusters of related STs (clonal complexes) were identified; the larger clonal complex (CC48) did not conform to a simple pattern of radial expansion from an assumed ancestor, while a second (CC70) corresponded to a simple radial expansion from ST70. Despite the large number of STs, overall nucleotide diversity was low. Of the Thai isolates, those isolated from patients with melioidosis were overrepresented in the 10 largest clones (P&lt;0.0001). There was a significant difference in the classification index between environmental and disease isolates (P&lt;0.001), confirming that genotypes were not distributed randomly between the two samples. MLST profiles for 158 isolates from Australia (mainly disease associated) contained a number of STs (96) similar to that seen with the Thai invasive isolates, but no ST was found in both populations. There were also differences in diversity and allele frequency distribution between the two populations. This analysis reveals strong genetic differentiation on the basis of geographical isolation and a significant differentiation on the basis of virulence potential.</p>

Mice carrying a targeted gene mutation of PSD-95 show altered behavioural plasticity including spatial learning, neuropathic pain, orientation preference in visual cortical cells, and cocaine sensitisation. These behavioural effects are accompanied by changes in long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. In vitro studies of PSD-95 signalling indicate that it may play a role in regulating dendritic spine structure. Here, we show that PSD-95 mutant mice have alterations in dendritic spine density in the striatum (a 15% decrease along the dendritic length) and in the hippocampus (a localised 40% increase) without changes in dendritic branch patterns or gross neuronal architecture. These changes in spine density were accompanied by altered expression of proteins known to interact with PSD-95, including NR2B and SAP102, suggesting that PSD-95 plays a role in regulating the expression and activation of proteins found within the NMDA receptor complex. Thus, PSD-95 is an important regulator of neuronal structure as well as plasticity in vivo.</p>

It is well established that solid tumor genomes accumulate a large number of genome rearrangements during tumorigenesis. End Sequence Profiling (ESP) maps and clones genome breakpoints associated with all types of genome rearrangements elucidating the structural organization of tumor genomes. Here we extend the ESP methodology in several directions using the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. First, targeted ESP is applied to multiple amplified loci, revealing a complex process of rearrangement and co-amplification in these regions reminiscent of breakage/fusion/bridge cycles. Second, genome breakpoints identified by ESP are confirmed using a combination of DNA sequencing and PCR. Third, in vitro functional studies assign biological function to a rearranged tumor BAC clone, demonstrating that it encodes anti-apoptotic activity. Finally, ESP is extended to the transcriptome identifying four novel fusion transcripts and providing evidence that expression of fusion genes may be common in tumors. These results demonstrate the distinct advantages of ESP including: (1) the ability to detect all types of rearrangements and copy number changes; (2) straightforward integration of ESP data with the annotated genome sequence; (3) immortalization of the genome; (4) ability to generate tumor-specific reagents for in vitro and in vivo functional studies. Given these properties, ESP could play an important role in a tumor genome project.</p>

The European Fission Yeast Meeting, held in March 2006, brought together a significant proportion of the Sz. pombe research community, so it was an ideal opportunity to hold a discussion session on the future needs of those working on this model organism. While the session generated a consensus on the most essential requirements, it also demonstrated the frustrations and concerns of those working with Sz. pombe. The community was also briefed regarding the future transition of the current database (Sz. pombe GeneDB) to a fully-fledged Model Organism Database (MOD) to support the needs of both fission yeast and the broader scientific community.</p>

Intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels increase in response to extracellular stimulation by hormones, neurotransmitters, or growth factors and are down-regulated through hydrolysis catalyzed by PDEs, which are therefore candidate therapeutic targets. cAMP is a second messenger implicated in learning, memory, and mood, and cGMP modulates nervous system processes that are controlled by the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway. To investigate an association between genes encoding PDEs and susceptibility to major depressive disorder (MDD), we genotyped SNPs in 21 genes of this superfamily in 284 depressed Mexican Americans who participated in a prospective, double-blind, pharmacogenetic study of antidepressant response, and 331 matched controls. Polymorphisms in PDE9A and PDE11A were found to be associated with the diagnosis of MDD. Our data are also suggestive of the association between SNPs in other PDE genes and MDD. Remission on antidepressants was significantly associated with polymorphisms in PDE1A and PDE11A. Thus, we found significant associations with both the diagnosis of MDD and remission in response to antidepressants with SNPs in the PDE11A gene. We show here that PDE11A haplotype GAACC is significantly associated with MDD. We conclude that PDE11A has a role in the pathophysiology of MDD. This study identifies a potential CNS role for the PDE11 family. The hypothesis that drugs affecting PDE function, particularly cGMP-related PDEs, represent a treatment strategy for major depression should therefore be tested.</p>

The three RAF genes code for cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS. ARAF and c-RAF are infrequently mutated in human cancer. However, BRAF is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. Most mutations are within the kinase domain, with a single amino acid substitution (V600E) accounting for most mutations.</p>

Sixteen new NRs were identified in the Platyhelminth trematode, Schistosoma mansoni. Three were found to possess novel tandem DNA-binding domains that identify a new subfamily of NR. Two NRs are homologues of the thyroid hormone receptor that previously were thought to be restricted to chordates. This study brings the total number of identified NR in S. mansoni to 21. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that S. mansoni NRs share an evolutionary lineage with that of arthropods and vertebrates. Phylogenic analysis shows that more than half of the S. mansoni nuclear receptors evolved from a second gene duplication. As the second gene duplication of NRs was thought to be specific to vertebrates, our data challenge the current theory of NR evolution.</p>

It has been shown elsewhere that carriers of the inactive gene are more resistant to severe sepsis. We have now investigated whether the inactive form has spread because of neutral drift or positive selection. We determined its distribution in a worldwide sample of 52 populations and resequenced the gene in 77 individuals from the HapMap Yoruba, Han Chinese, and European populations. There is strong evidence of positive selection from low diversity, skewed allele-frequency spectra, and the predominance of a single haplotype. We suggest that the inactive form of the gene arose in Africa approximately 100-500 thousand years ago (KYA) and was initially neutral or almost neutral but that positive selection beginning approximately 60-100 KYA drove it to near fixation. We further propose that its selective advantage was sepsis resistance in populations that experienced more infectious diseases as population sizes and densities increased.</p>

We have investigated male demography in East Asia, applying a Bayesian full-likelihood analysis to data from 988 men representing 27 populations from China, Mongolia, Korea, and Japan typed with 45 binary and 16 STR markers from the Y chromosome. According to our analysis, the northern populations examined all started to expand in number between 34 (18-68) and 22 (12-39) thousand years ago (KYA), before the last glacial maximum at 21-18 KYA, while the southern populations all started to expand between 18 (6-47) and 12 (1-45) KYA, but then grew faster. We suggest that the northern populations expanded earlier because they could exploit the abundant megafauna of the &quot;Mammoth Steppe,&quot; while the southern populations could increase in number only when a warmer and more stable climate led to more plentiful plant resources such as tubers.</p>

These maps demonstrate the conservation of such syntenic segment associations as HSA3/21, 4/8, 7/16, 12/22, 14/15 and 16/19 in Eulipotyphla, Pholidota and Xenarthra and thus further consolidate the notion that they form part of the ancestral karyotype of the eutherian mammals. Our study has revealed many potential ancestral syntenic associations of human chromosomal segments that serve to link the families as well as orders within the major superordinial eutherian clades defined by molecular markers. The HSA2/8 and 7/10 associations could be the cytogenetic signatures that unite the Xenarthrans, while the HSA1/19p could be a putative signature that links the Afrotheria and Xenarthra. But caution is required in the interpretation of apparently shared syntenic associations as detailed analyses also show examples of apparent convergent evolution that differ in breakpoints and extent of the involved segments.</p>

Representing one of the major technical improvements of FISH technology, this method has been used extensively in the field of chromosome and genome research, as well as in clinical studies, and serves as an important tool to bridge molecular analysis and cytological description. In this short review, the development and significance of this method will be briefly summarized using a limited number of examples to illustrate the large body of literature. In addition to descriptions of technical considerations, future applications and perspectives have also been discussed focusing specifically on the areas of genome organization, gene expression and medical research. We anticipate that this versatile method will play an important role in the study of the structure and function of the dynamic genome and for the development of potential applications for medical research.</p>

The modern insectivores are thus crucial for understanding the systematics and phylogeny of eutherian mammals as a whole. Here cross-species chromosome painting, with probes derived from flow-sorted chromosomes of human, was used to delimit the homologous chromosomal segments in two Soricidae species, the common shrew (Sorex araneus, 2n = 20/21), and Asiatic short-tailed shrew (Blarinella griselda, 2n = 44), and one Erinaceidae species, the shrew-hedgehog (Neotetracus sinensis, 2n = 32), and human. We report herewith the first comparative maps for the Asiatic short-tailed shrew and the shrew-hedgehog, in addition to a refined comparative map for the common shrew. In total, the 22 human autosomal paints detected 40, 51 and 58 evolutionarily conserved segments in the genomes of common shrew, Asiatic short-tailed shrew, and shrew-hedgehog, respectively, demonstrating that the common shrew has retained a conserved genome organization while the Asiatic short-tailed shrew and shrew-hedgehog have relatively rearranged genomes. In addition to confirming the existence of such ancestral human segmental combinations as HSA 3/21, 12/22, 14/15 and 7/16 that are shared by most eutherian mammals, our study reveals a shared human segmental combination, HSA 4/20, that could phylogenetically unite the Eulipotyphlan (i.e., the core insectivores) species. Our results provide cytogenetic evidence for the polyphyly of the order Insectivora and additional data for the eventual reconstruction of the ancestral eutherian karyotype.</p>

Their major functions are poorly understood, although some are implicated in nervous system development. As tumor-specific promoter methylation is a marker for tumor suppressor genes (TSG), we searched for epigenetically inactivated TSGs using methylation-subtraction combined with pharmacologic demethylation, and identified the PCDH10 CpG island as a methylated sequence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). PCDH10 is broadly expressed in all normal adult and fetal tissues including the epithelia, though at different levels. It resides at 4q28.3--a region with hemizygous deletion detected by array-CGH in NPC cell lines; however, PCDH10 itself is not located within the deletion. In contrast, its transcriptional silencing and promoter methylation were frequently detected in multiple carcinoma cell lines in a biallelic way, including 12/12 nasopharyngeal, 13/16 esophageal, 3/4 breast, 5/5 colorectal, 3/4 cervical, 2/5 lung and 2/8 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, but not in any immortalized normal epithelial cell line. Aberrant methylation was further frequently detected in multiple primary carcinomas (82% in NPC, 42-51% for other carcinomas), but not normal tissues. The transcriptional silencing of PCDH10 could be reversed by pharmacologic demethylation with 5-aza-2&#39;-deoxycytidine or genetic demethylation with double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, indicating a direct epigenetic mechanism. Ectopic expression of PCDH10 strongly suppressed tumor cell growth, migration, invasion and colony formation. Although the epigenetic and genetic disruptions of several classical cadherins as TSGs have been well documented in tumors, this is the first report that a widely expressed protocadherin can also function as a TSG that is frequently inactivated epigenetically in multiple carcinomas.</p>

Genes for the symbiotic interaction with plants are well studied, but the adaptations that allow survival and growth in the soil environment are poorly understood. We have sequenced the genome of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae strain 3841.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Results</strong>: The 7.75 Mb genome comprises a circular chromosome and six circular plasmids, with 61% G+C overall. All three rRNA operons and 52 tRNA genes are on the chromosome; essential protein-encoding genes are largely chromosomal, but most functional classes occur on plasmids as well. Of the 7,263 protein-encoding genes, 2,056 had orthologs in each of three related genomes (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Mesorhizobium loti), and these genes were over-represented in the chromosome and had above average G+C. Most supported the rRNA-based phylogeny, confirming A. tumefaciens to be the closest among these relatives, but 347 genes were incompatible with this phylogeny; these were scattered throughout the genome but were over-represented on the plasmids. An unexpectedly large number of genes were shared by all three rhizobia but were missing from A. tumefaciens.</p><p class="abstract"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overall, the genome can be considered to have two main components: a &#39;core&#39;, which is higher in G+C, is mostly chromosomal, is shared with related organisms, and has a consistent phylogeny; and an &#39;accessory&#39; component, which is sporadic in distribution, lower in G+C, and located on the plasmids and chromosomal islands. The accessory genome has a different nucleotide composition from the core despite a long history of coexistence.</p>

Patients who carry constitutional deletions of 17q21.3-q24 exhibit distinct phenotypic features. Within the deletion interval, there is a genomic segment that is bounded by the myeloperoxidase and homeobox B1 genes. This genomic segment is syntenically conserved on mouse chromosome 11 and is bounded by the mouse homologs of the same genes (Mpo and HoxB1). To attain functional information about this syntenic segment in mice, we have generated a 6.9-Mb deletion [Df(11)18], the reciprocal duplication [Dp(11)18] between Mpo and Chad (the chondroadherin gene), and a 1.8-Mb deletion between Chad and HoxB1. Phenotypic analyses of the mutant mouse lines showed that the Dp(11)18/Dp(11)18 genotype was responsible for embryonic or adolescent lethality, whereas the Df(11)18/+ genotype was responsible for heart defects. The cardiovascular phenotype of the Df(11)18/+ fetuses was similar to those of patients who carried the deletions of 17q21.3-q24. Since heart defects were not detectable in Df(11)18/Dp(11)18 mice, the haplo-insufficiency of one or more genes located between Mpo and Chad may be responsible for the abnormal cardiovascular phenotype. Therefore, we have identified a new dosage-sensitive genomic region that may be critical for normal heart development in both mice and humans.</p>

We present, here, comparative results based on draft sequences of 37 bacterial artificial clones (BAC) clones selected by chromosome painting for this special muntjac species. Sequence comparison on these BAC clones uncovered sequence syntenic relationships between the muntjac genome and those of other mammals. We found that the muntjac genome has peculiar features with respect to intron size and evolutionary rates of genes. Inspection of more than 80 pairs of orthologous introns from 15 genes reveals a significant reduction in intron size in the Indian muntjac compared to that of human, mouse, and dog. Evolutionary analysis using 19 genes indicates that the muntjac genes have evolved rapidly compared to other mammals. In addition, we identified and characterized sequence composition of the first BAC clone containing a chromosomal fusion site. Our results shed new light on the genome architecture of the Indian muntjac and suggest that chromosomal rearrangements have been accompanied by other salient genomic changes.</p>

<p class="affiliation">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, 7 Cambridge Center, Massachusetts 02142, USA.</p><p class="abstract">Chromosome 17 is unusual among the human chromosomes in many respects. It is the largest human autosome with orthology to only a single mouse chromosome, mapping entirely to the distal half of mouse chromosome 11. Chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes, having the second highest gene density in the genome. It is also enriched in segmental duplications, ranking third in density among the autosomes. Here we report a finished sequence for human chromosome 17, as well as a structural comparison with the finished sequence for mouse chromosome 11, the first finished mouse chromosome. Comparison of the orthologous regions reveals striking differences. In contrast to the typical pattern seen in mammalian evolution, the human sequence has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement, whereas the mouse sequence has been remarkably stable. Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density. Notably, these segmental duplications correspond closely to the sites of structural rearrangement, demonstrating a link between duplication and rearrangement. Examination of the main classes of duplicated segments provides insight into the dynamics underlying expansion of chromosome-specific, low-copy repeats in the human genome.</p>

Perutz Laboratories, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Medical University of Vienna, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.</p><p class="abstract">Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from core histones. Because of their capacity to induce local condensation of chromatin, HDACs are generally considered repressors of transcription. In this report, we analyzed the role of the class I histone deacetylase HDAC1 as a transcriptional regulator by comparing the expression profiles of wild-type and HDAC1-deficient embryonic stem cells. A specific subset of mouse genes (7%) was deregulated in the absence of HDAC1. We identified several putative tumor suppressors (JunB, Prss11, and Plagl1) and imprinted genes (Igf2, H19, and p57) as novel HDAC1 targets. The majority of HDAC1 target genes showed reduced expression accompanied by recruitment of HDAC1 and local reduction in histone acetylation at regulatory regions. At some target genes, the related deacetylase HDAC2 partially masks the loss of HDAC1. A second group of genes was found to be downregulated in HDAC1-deficient cells, predominantly by additional recruitment of HDAC2 in the absence of HDAC1. Finally, a small set of genes (Gja1, Irf1, and Gbp2) was found to require HDAC activity and recruitment of HDAC1 for their transcriptional activation. Our study reveals a regulatory cross talk between HDAC1 and HDAC2 and a novel function for HDAC1 as a transcriptional coactivator.</p>
